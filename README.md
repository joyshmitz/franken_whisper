</div>

**Agent-first Rust ASR stack with a real in-process pure-Rust Whisper engine (no FFI, no Python, no subprocess), adaptive Bayesian backend routing, real-time NDJSON streaming (true-live mic/pipe streaming via `fw robot listen`; batch robot mode streams sequenced stage events), DTW word timestamps, and SQLite-backed run history. In current live-incumbent, same-invocation matched-greedy CPU comparisons, the native large-v3-turbo engine is 2.99× faster than whisper.cpp on a 124.5-second whole job; tiny.en is 1.52× faster on a 124.5-second transcribe-only workload and 1.51× faster on a 300-second transcribe-only workload.**

## Agent quickstart

The release installs two equivalent binary names: `fw` is the concise
agent-facing name, and `franken_whisper` remains the descriptive name. Start
with the live triage payload instead of scraping help text:

```bash
fw --version
fw robot triage
fw capabilities --json
fw models --json
fw pull all --json
fw doctor --json
fw robot schema
fw robot listen --list-devices   # live streaming capture check
```

`fw robot run --input AUDIO --backend auto` streams NDJSON. Robot syntax
errors are also emitted as one path-safe JSON object on stdout with exit code
2; runtime failures use one of the 13 exact `FW-*` codes published by
`fw capabilities --json`. Discovery, inference, and doctor commands do not
download models. `fw pull all` is the explicit in-binary network path for the
native defaults. It streams the 1,624,555,275-byte Whisper package and the
separately licensed 491,570,584-byte Sortformer package into the per-user cache,
then admits each only after its compiled size and SHA-256 trust roots pass. The
installer runs that command by default. A doctor `ready` result means both
packages passed static preflight; the payload still sets
`operationally_verified: false` until an actual transcription succeeds. The
model weights are never stored in Git. Whisper is distributed as the
`whisper-large-v3-turbo-f16-v1` release artifact; its GGML f16 bytes are
identity-preserved from the pinned upstream revision and selected for the native
Rust loader and optimized FrankenTorch kernels. Sortformer is distributed as
`sortformer-v2.1-f32-v1` beside the NVIDIA Open Model License, required notice,
and deterministic conversion receipt.
Release archives also carry [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md),
which records the licensed libc++ selection logic translated into safe Rust for
the pinned PyTorch CPU top-k parity contract.

> **The native engine is real, fast, and benchmarked at matched decode settings.** The in-process pure-Rust Whisper engine (built on [FrankenTorch](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentorch) kernels) is compared below against the actual `whisper-cli` incumbent, side-by-side in one harness invocation with both engines using greedy decode. The whole-job turbo row matches 279/279 words at **WER 0.010753**; the tiny.en reference conformance remains **WER 0.0000**. The full measurement record is in [the performance ledger](docs/PERF_LEDGER.md).
>
> | Model / workload | Mode | Matched-greedy result |
> |---|---|---|
> | large-v3-turbo, 124.5 s / 5 windows | whole job, no timestamps | **2.99× faster** |
> | tiny.en, 124.5 s / 5 windows | transcribe only, no timestamps | **1.52× faster** |
> | tiny.en, 300 s / 10 windows | transcribe only, no timestamps | **1.51× faster** |

## The Problem

Speech-to-text pipelines are fragmented. Existing stacks combine `whisper.cpp` for speed, `insanely-fast-whisper` for GPU batching, and Python diarization systems for speaker attribution. Each has its own CLI, output format, error handling, and deployment story. Orchestrating them from scripts means parsing inconsistent stdout, handling timeouts manually, killing zombie subprocesses, and losing all run history when something crashes.

Agent workflows make the problem worse. Modern LLM agents need **structured**, **streaming**, **machine-readable** output, not human-oriented terminal decorations that break the moment they touch `jq`, pipes, or SSH.

## The Solution

`franken_whisper` is a single Rust binary that wraps every major Whisper backend behind a unified, agent-first interface — and ships its own engine:

- **A real in-process Whisper engine, in pure Rust.** ggml model parsing, log-mel frontend, encoder/decoder transformer inference on FrankenTorch CPU kernels, greedy decoding with whisper.cpp's full timestamp-rule suite, and cross-attention DTW word timestamps. No FFI, no Python, no subprocess — drop a ggml model file in place and transcribe.
- **Rust-native Sortformer speaker diarization by default.** The in-process fused model emits anonymous activity lanes and overlapping turns for up to four speakers, then projects that independent timeline onto Whisper segments. It remains development-uncertified: four lanes are a hard capacity boundary, not proof that a recording has no additional speakers. Known intervals and requests beyond that capacity use the bounded acoustic path, which is an available but uncertified fallback. Explicit ECAPA modes remain available for experiments with pinned speaker embeddings. None of these modes claims gender or biometric identity.
- **Adaptive Bayesian backend routing.** Each `auto` request runs a formal decision contract with an explicit loss matrix, per-backend Beta posteriors, Brier-scored calibration, and deterministic fallback when the model is mis-calibrated.
- **Real-time NDJSON streaming.** Every pipeline stage emits sequenced, timestamped events on stable schema `v1.1.0` (the 1.0.0 contract plus the additive listen-event family). No fragile regex; agents parse JSON.
- **Durable run history.** Every transcription persists to SQLite with full event logs, replay envelopes, and JSONL export/import, even when the process crashes mid-run.
- **Cooperative cancellation.** Ctrl+C propagates through the pipeline via
  cancellation tokens. Owned subprocess trees are terminated and verified,
  transactions roll back via savepoints, and finalizers run within a bounded
  budget. Cleanup failures are reported instead of being relabeled as clean
  cancellation.
- **No external decoder for common audio.** MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG,
  Vorbis, and ALAC decode in-process via `symphonia`. `ffmpeg` is a fallback
  for video and exotic codecs, and is auto-provisioned on Linux x86_64 if
  missing.
- **Native engine rollout governance.** In-process Rust replacements follow a 5-stage rollout (Shadow → Validated → Fallback → Primary → Sole). The shipped default is `Sole`, so bridges run only after an explicit operator opt-out or rollout override.
- **TTY audio transport.** Compressed audio (mu-law + zlib + base64) over PTY links with handshake, integrity hashes, deterministic retransmission, and an adaptive bitrate controller. Transcript-streaming control frames (protocol v2) carry speculation events end-to-end over the same link.
- **Word-level timestamps.** First-class support via `whisper.cpp`'s word-timestamp pipeline, with the cancellation token threaded into the inner extraction loop.

## Design Philosophy

### Agent-First, Human-Optional

The primary interface is `robot`. Every command in robot mode emits sequenced, timestamped NDJSON on stdout with schema version `1.1.0` (bumped additively from `1.0.0` when the listen event family landed; batch events are unchanged). Human-friendly output (`transcribe` without `--json`) is the exception. Robot mode never mixes decorative stderr into the data stream; structured `run_error` envelopes replace human prose even for argument-parsing failures.

### Deterministic by Default

Given identical inputs and parameters, `franken_whisper` produces identical outputs. The TTY retransmit loop, replay envelopes, replay packs, and conformance harness all enforce determinism. Random elements (UUIDs, wall-clock timestamps) are quarantined to metadata fields; they never enter computational output.

### Fail Loud, Recover Gracefully

Every error has a structured code (`FW-IO`, `FW-CMD-TIMEOUT`, `FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE`, `FW-STAGE-TIMEOUT`, …) and propagates through the NDJSON event stream. Cancellation tokens let in-flight work checkpoint and clean up instead of dying mid-write. In-progress SQLite transactions roll back via savepoints; owned subprocess trees are terminated and checked; temporary resources are handled by registered finalizers under a bounded budget.

### Composition Over Configuration

The pipeline is **composed** dynamically per request. The 10 canonical stages (Ingest, Normalize, VAD, Source Separate, Backend, Accelerate, Align, Punctuate, Diarize, Persist) are skipped when unnecessary, budgeted independently, and profiled automatically. The `PipelineBuilder` validates ordering at build time; runtime never hits "stage X requires stage Y" errors.

### Audited Unsafe Boundaries

The crate uses `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`. Native-engine SIMD and
fully-overwritten-buffer kernels opt in at explicit sites with local safety
arguments; unannotated unsafe code is rejected. The performance rationale and
measurements are retained in
[`docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md).

### No External Decoder for Common Audio

`franken_whisper` decodes MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG (Vorbis), and ALAC entirely in-process via `symphonia`; no `ffmpeg`, no Python, no `PATH` lookup. `ffmpeg` is only invoked as a fallback for video files, exotic codecs (AC3, DTS, Opus-in-MKV), and live microphone capture. When `ffmpeg` *is* needed and missing on Linux x86_64, it is downloaded once into the per-user state directory.

### Adaptive Controllers With Conservative Fallbacks

Every adaptive controller in the system (the backend router, the speculative window controller, the budget tuner, the TTY adaptive bitrate controller, the correction tracker) ships with an explicit *alien-artifact engineering contract*: state space, action space, loss matrix, posterior, calibration metric, deterministic fallback, and an evidence ledger. When models drift, the system **falls back to a deterministic policy** rather than confidently making bad decisions.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Pre-built Binary)

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_whisper/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
```

The installer downloads the release asset for the detected platform, verifies
its SHA-256 checksum, validates the staged binary's self-reported version, and
installs both `fw` and `franken_whisper` to `~/.local/bin`. It then downloads
and verifies the pinned native Whisper and Sortformer packages (about 2.12 GB
combined). Interactive installs show a `Y/n` prompt with **Yes** as the default;
quiet and headless installs provision automatically. `--no-pull` is the explicit
opt-out. An offline install accepts a preseeded verified cache or requires
`--no-pull`; it never contacts the network. Under `sudo ... --system`, model
provisioning drops back to the validated invoking user so the packages do not
land in root's private cache. A release download failure never silently falls
back to a source build; use `--from-source` explicitly. Before a fresh model
pull, the installer requires at least 2.4 GB free on the cache filesystem; an
already-complete cache is admitted after both compiled trust roots are verified.

Options:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--system` | Install to `/usr/local/bin` instead of `~/.local/bin` |
| `--easy-mode` | Auto-update shell `PATH` and rc files |
| `--verify` | Verify both binary names, agent schemas, and both native model packages |
| `--no-pull` | Skip automatic native Whisper and Sortformer model provisioning |
| `--version vX.Y.Z` | Pin to a specific release |
| `--force` | Reinstall even if the same version is present |
| `--offline TARBALL` | Airgap install from a local archive (verifies sibling `.sha256`) |
| `--from-source` | Build from a source clone (clones sibling FrankenSuite deps) |
| `--quiet` / `--no-gum` | Script-friendly / plain-ANSI output |
| `--no-verify` | Skip checksum verification (testing only) |
| `--uninstall` | Remove both binary names and installer-added `PATH` lines |

`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` are honored on every download.
`FW_INSTALL_PROMPT_TIMEOUT` changes the interactive prompt timeout from 120
seconds, and `FRANKEN_WHISPER_MODEL_DIR` selects an absolute cache root shared
by `fw pull all`, model discovery, and the installer. Prebuilt targets are
`linux_amd64`, `linux_arm64`, `darwin_amd64`, `darwin_arm64`, and
`windows_amd64` (zip; manual install on native Windows).

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/franken-whisper
fw pull all
```

Homebrew installs both binary names but does not bundle model weights. The
second command downloads the same SHA-256-pinned native Whisper and Sortformer
packages used by the installer. Model inference remains offline after that
one-time provisioning step.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/franken_whisper.git
cd franken_whisper

# Provision the exact clean sibling commits used by release builds.
# Existing mismatched sibling directories are never modified.
scripts/prepare_release_siblings.sh

# default CLI and library
cargo build --locked --release --bins

# with TUI support
cargo build --release --features tui
```

The native engine always uses FrankenTorch CPU kernels. On macOS, large eligible
matrix operations automatically use the target-gated Metal kernel when a Metal
device is available; `FRANKEN_WHISPER_GPU=0` forces CPU execution. The only
production Cargo feature is `tui`; `fj-oracle` enables a test-only FrankenJAX
differential oracle and is not a runtime acceleration backend. The release
profile uses `opt-level = 3`, full LTO, one codegen unit, `panic = "abort"`, and
stripped symbols.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust nightly** (2024 edition; pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- **ffmpeg** (optional): needed for video files, exotic codecs `symphonia` cannot decode, batch `transcribe --mic`, and as the fallback live-capture backend when cpal cannot open the device. On Linux x86_64 it is auto-provisioned on first use unless `FRANKEN_WHISPER_AUTO_PROVISION_FFMPEG=0`.
- **The two native default model packages.** The installer provisions them, or run `fw pull all`. Native Whisper uses the pinned `whisper-large-v3-turbo-f16-v1` GGML f16 release; native diarization uses the pinned four-lane `sortformer-v2.1-f32-v1` package. Both are hash-checked against compiled trust roots. No external backend binary is required for the default pipeline. The native engine's ggml parser accepts f32 and f16 `.bin` models (`hparams.ftype` 0/1); quantized ggml variants are rejected today and remain on the roadmap (see [`docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`](docs/PERF_LEDGER.md) for the measured f16 frontier).
- **The pinned ECAPA package** (only for `ecapa` or `ecapa-fused`): `ecapa_tdnn_voxceleb.safetensors`, SHA-256 `9276a840c52cdd2e9afb73cd87a38e15749e12bf494d3ca47b5bc162f237cbcc`, under `$FRANKEN_WHISPER_MODEL_DIR/aux/` or `~/.cache/franken_whisper/models/aux/`. The converted artifact is not published, so `scripts/fetch_aux_models.sh` prints the pinned conversion instructions and expected digest instead of downloading it.
- **Bridge backend binaries** (optional explicit alternates):
  - `whisper-cli` (from whisper.cpp); override via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_WHISPER_CPP_BIN`
  - `insanely-fast-whisper` (Python entry point); override via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_INSANELY_FAST_BIN`
  - `python3` with `pyannote.audio` installed (only for the optional external diarization backend); override via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_PYTHON_BIN`
- **HuggingFace token** (external diarization only): `--hf-token`, `FRANKEN_WHISPER_HF_TOKEN`, or `HF_TOKEN`. Native acoustic and ECAPA diarization need neither Python nor a token; the ECAPA modes do require the local package above.

### Sibling Crate Dependencies

`franken_whisper` integrates several crates from the FrankenSuite ecosystem.
Published packages resolve them from **crates.io**. A source checkout uses
versioned path dependencies for the exact local FrankenSQLite, FrankenTorch,
FrankenTTS, optional FrankenTUI, and optional FrankenJAX sources;
`scripts/prepare_release_siblings.sh` stages
the release-pinned sibling commits without modifying an existing mismatched
checkout.

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Transcription

```bash
# plain text
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3

# full JSON report (segments + timing + backend identity + replay envelope)
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --json

# explicit backend
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --backend whisper-cpp --json

# language hint
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --language ja --json
```

### 2. Robot Mode (Agent Integration)

```bash
franken_whisper robot run --input audio.mp3 --backend auto
```

Output (one JSON object per line, schema `1.1.0`):

```json

```

### 3. Speaker Diarization

```bash
franken_whisper transcribe --input meeting.mp3 --json
```

The default path runs the native four-lane Sortformer package and returns
anonymous `SPEAKER_NN` turns. It is fast, in-process, and development-
uncertified: a lane count is not a calibrated estimate of the true number of
speakers, and recordings with more than four speakers exceed the model's
capacity. Use `--no-diarize` for transcription only.

Turn evidence is fused into the transcript (`projection-fusion-v1`): every
segment that overlaps a labeled turn gets that speaker, segments in short turn
gaps take the nearest labeled turn within 2 seconds, and word-level speaker
changes snap to the nearest sentence-final punctuation within four words so
turn-initial words land on the speaker who says them. The result also carries
`diarization.speaker_segments`, a merged view of consecutive same-speaker runs
with joined text and duration-weighted turn confidence, so consumers do not
rebuild the turn/segment join. Untimed segments and audio beyond the gap bound
stay `speaker: null`. Requests with known
intervals or count constraints beyond the four-lane boundary fall back to the
native acoustic engine under the default `acoustic` fallback policy.

On this project's Apple M4 Pro development host, a repeated-public-audio
ten-minute probe took 35.86 seconds end to end for Sortformer (29.91 seconds of
model inference, inference RTF 0.04984). That scales to about 3.6 minutes of
diarization per audio hour when one model load is included. The matched native
Whisper probe took about 9.0 minutes per audio hour, for roughly 12.6 minutes
combined. This is a throughput orientation row, not a natural-conversation
accuracy result or a promise for other hardware.

Omitting all count options means inference intent. Acoustic and ECAPA reports
contain a versioned `speaker_count.estimate` object and retain explicit
uncalibrated/unresolved mass. A soft preference can be added with
`--speaker-count-range 2..5` or
`--speaker-count-prior 2=0.25,3=0.75`. Use
`--speaker-count-hard 3` only when the caller intentionally wants a hard search
constraint; it never fabricates occupancy or removes UNKNOWN. Soft count
options are supported by the native acoustic, `ecapa`, and `ecapa-fused`
engines; external backends reject them rather than silently hardening them.

Known intervals can enroll an opaque speaker reference without retaining the
hint document's source path or raw source bytes:

```json
{"schema_version":"speaker-hints-v1","known_intervals":[
  {"speaker_ref":"caller_a","start_ms":1200,"end_ms":5400,
   "confidence":0.98,"policy":"hard_must_link"}
]}
```

Pass it with `--speaker-hints /private/path/hints.json`. Hard intervals are
immutable must-links; soft enrollment can be rejected when acoustically
contradictory. Parsed hint fields are part of the typed request and are
persisted with the run unless `--no-persist` is used. Labels remain within-run
references, not biometric identities.

When `known_intervals` is nonempty, execution rejects both an external engine
and `--diarization-fallback external`: external labels cannot enforce immutable
hint identities, so this combination fails closed instead of discarding them.

Evaluation uses the frozen `diarization-scorer-v5` contract. In addition to
DER/JER, it reports typed speaker-count evidence with explicit authority,
unresolved and zero-probability outcomes, effective occupancy,
dominant/reference collapse, phantom labels, and optional transcript-free
aligned-word WDER. Fixed-safe results are explicitly uncalibrated, and current
probabilistic results are development-uncertified; neither is described as a
calibrated posterior unless a future certified authority says so.
This prevents a nominally correct label count from hiding a run where one
label received nearly all speech. Public ablations aggregate these metrics by
reference count and duration; `diarization-eval` emits the same evidence only
as a path-free, aggregate-only confidential result. Aligned-word inputs retain
opaque non-lexical IDs and timing/speaker annotations, never token text. See
[`docs/acoustic_diarization_contract.md`](docs/acoustic_diarization_contract.md)
for the versioned schemas and fail-closed policy.

The multiscale acoustic sidecar is exposed only through the separate public
evaluation command `diarization-corpus sidecar-study`, using
`public-diarization-acoustic-sidecar-study-v6` and its v8 runner. It is not a
`transcribe` option: normal segmentation, clustering, robot output,
persistence, and the normal transcription route are not mutated by the
sidecar study. This is a routing guarantee, not a claim that current reports
are byte-identical to historical acoustic-v2 reports. The command runs a
frozen full-v2 baseline plus twelve ordered sidecar lanes, retains only
aggregate path-free and transcript-free evidence, and creates both outputs in
external directories on Linux, Android, and Apple platforms. Other targets
return `public_corpus.output_platform` before corpus materialization. On a
successful supported-platform run, stdout bytes exactly match the retained
study evidence file.

The frozen protocol uses oracle VAD speech regions while leaving speaker count
in inferred mode. Its DER/JER and speaker-count results therefore measure
segmentation and clustering conditioned on reference speech activity; they are
not end-to-end VAD-accuracy evidence.

Development fits separate adjacent-boundary and lagged different-speaker
calibrations. The boundary-fusion-v2 configuration hash binds the selected change-detector
mode as well as the sidecar/calibration and selector constants, so materially
different fallback and peak-selection behavior cannot share an identity.
Conditional diagnostics begin with one lane-independent universe
of uniquely reference-labeled 25/50/100/200-frame-lag pairs. Each recording
retains at most 4,096 members by a score-, label-, and availability-independent
selection-key-v3 SHA-256 over normalized clipped PCM identity, frame indices,
and lag. The pair scorer is separately protocol-bound and is not part of that
key. A reference-labeled selected-sequence-v2 digest binds every retained key,
frame pair, lag, and same/different label and must match across evaluated lanes. Evidence
retains aggregate selected/scored same/different counts, overall and per-class
score coverage, recording support, linked reliability moments, and a 100-bin
score-order histogram; it retains no selected keys, labels, frame indices, or
probabilities. The producer bins exact clamped-`f32` scores. The verifier checks
linked counts, class moments, and first/second-moment feasibility against each
bin's exact clamped-`f32` support, which rejects direct aggregate
contradictions. Because the individual selected probabilities are
intentionally omitted, those sufficient statistics cannot establish every
member's bin assignment or replay score ordering; they are aggregate internal-
consistency evidence, not member-level provenance. Promotion requires at least
0.25 total and per-class score coverage, 100 scored pairs and five recordings in each class, pair
discrimination/calibration bounds, and substantial owner-specific same-speaker
auxiliary-dominance evidence wherever Voice and that owner coexist.

A completed study is not an automatic promotion. The artifact records whether
each candidate was rejected, advanced for held-out certification, or adopted,
and no lane has such authority until a real public-corpus result establishes
it. When any lane is accuracy-eligible, development ranks one winner first; if
that lane fails an operational bound, no lower-ranked lane advances. RTF and
RSS are host-dependent observations against the live unfused baseline in the
same invocation; passing them is not a speed or memory-win claim. The
deterministic accuracy projection removes performance-only failures and
`NotSelectedByRanking`, zeros timing/RSS, allocator capacities, and target-sized
retained-state bytes, and clears certification's locked development result hash
while retaining its accuracy hash before recomputing selection/adoption.

The verifier recomputes aggregate metrics, fine/coarse score-distribution
consistency, coverages, gates, ranking, dispositions, and hashes. It validates
calibration fingerprints and fit-count provenance, but aggregate evidence
cannot prove each omitted probability's histogram membership, refit
calibrations, regenerate selected pairs, replay audio-derived metrics, or
reproduce bootstrap intervals; verification proves aggregate internal
consistency, not member-level provenance or corpus replay. Paired intervals use a fixed versioned
lane/split seed and a cancellable SplitMix64 stream. Reference annotations use
a monotonic overlap-aware sweep instead of rescanning all turns every 10 ms.

The library's `adversarial_corpus` module supplies a Rust-native, public-safe
accuracy harness without checking audio fixtures into the repository. It
generates transcript-free harmonic calls with deterministic speaker, turn,
overlap, pitch, playback, and stereo regimes, then applies bounded gain,
muffling, band-limit, resampling, quantization, clipping, noise, reverb,
interruption, silence, channel-shift, playback, channel-swap, and overlap
recipes. Retained repro seeds contain parameters, stable classifications, and
content hashes—not samples, paths, transcripts, embeddings, or real speaker
identifiers. Plans declare synthetic source authority or bind a hash of an
external public-license acknowledgement. The same API attributes the first
divergent pipeline stage and delta-minimizes a failing transform sequence while
preserving its exact classification.

For development-only differential diagnosis, `diarization-oracle` can compare
the native stage document with an operator-installed pyannote, NeMo spectral,
VBx, EEND, DiaPer, or Sortformer adapter. Start with
`franken_whisper diarization-oracle registry`, then run the selected adapter
against absolute external audio and stage-document paths. Comparisons are
separate for speech activity, opaque word timing, change boundaries,
label-permutation-invariant clusters, overlap, and final projection. Missing
or failing tools produce a path-free skipped report; disagreements are
diagnostic only and can never certify that the native path is wrong. External
tools remain optional subprocesses with no normal runtime or Cargo dependency.
The Sortformer entry is narrower than the generic adapters: it pins
[`nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/diar_streaming_sortformer_4spk-v2.1)
at immutable revision `fafaab5faa1617a0ca52d38dd3dc4bd636800d3d`, requires
canonical mono 16 kHz PCM16 WAV input, and freezes the documented high-latency
340/40/40/300/188 streaming-cache profile plus untuned 0.5/0.5 post-processing.
The `300` value is the configured cache-update period. Pinned NeMo only warns
when it is shorter than the 340-frame chunk; its FIFO update computes
`min(max(configured, chunk - fifo_capacity + current_fifo), current_fifo + chunk)`.
That moves 300 frames on the first full chunk and 340 in the full-chunk steady
state, while tail chunks remain state-dependent.
The accepted v2 operator adapter fails closed unless installed package metadata
binds NeMo to commit `40ace43c7cf151af78dc22027c02feeca7e06b6a` and the frozen
Python/PyTorch/torchaudio/NumPy versions. It derives BLAS and CPU-feature facts
from the installed runtimes and asserts the raw streaming profile plus the
derived FIFO-pop schedule after NeMo validates it; those facts may not be
supplied by literals alone.
The operator-installed adapter remains an explicit trust boundary. The host
hashes its resolved path before execution, rejects an initial mismatch against
the compiled SHA-256 pin, and rechecks the path after the version probe and
oracle run before validating schema and attestations. This catches ordinary
drift, but a swap-and-restore inside the remaining hash-to-exec window is still
an open oracle-authority gate. Activation-seam capture therefore uses a
separately reviewed exporter and digest; the final-output adapter pin does not
authorize intermediate values.
The first admitted activation pack is synthetic-only: four deterministic
non-human frontend fixtures, 46 F32/I64 tensors, and 44 stage-level replay
observations that are byte-exact across five runs requested in each configured
one-thread and eight-thread regime.
Rust authenticates the separate receipt/package roots and runs the complete f32
graph in process through L8 anonymous speaker turns. The same engine powers the
default pipeline and remains available through a focused diagnostic command:

```bash
fw pull sortformer --json
fw sortformer-diarize --input call.m4a

# Optional caller assertions/suggestions for anonymous-lane mapping:
fw sortformer-diarize --input call.m4a --speaker-hints /private/hints.json
```

The bounded hint file can be a bare interval array or this versioned form:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "speaker-hints-v1",
  "known_intervals": [
    {
      "speaker_ref": "speaker-a",
      "start_ms": 1200,
      "end_ms": 4800,
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "policy": "hard_must_link",
      "provenance": "caller-context"
    }
  ]
}
```

`fw pull` is restartable across verified per-file cache hits, cooperative under
Ctrl+C, and never emits cache paths in JSON mode. The installer invokes
`fw pull all` by default; inference stays offline. The focused diarization command
rehashes the cached package and conversion receipt, runs completely offline,
and emits one path-free `sortformer-diarization-v1` object with turns, inferred
active-lane count, timing, and the candid capacity status
`four_lane_capped_output_true_speaker_count_unknown`; an inferred lane count is
never presented as proof that the recording contains no additional speakers.
Hard known intervals may bind a
unique anonymous lane to a caller-provided opaque reference; contradictory or
ambiguous hard evidence fails closed. Soft intervals remain non-authoritative
suggestions, every non-hard-bound lane remains anonymous, and inference never
mutates model weights. `--diarization-engine auto` now selects this native
runtime under the owner-directed default. The model registry and focused
diagnostic command report `development_uncertified`. The
authenticated NVIDIA-recommended streaming
truth pack covers four public fixtures and 4,540 L1-L8 tensors. On its complete
102-second three-speaker row, native L5 probabilities stayed within the frozen
envelope (maximum absolute difference `1.072883606e-6`, relative L2
`8.214150678e-8`), and L7 activity plus all 16 L8 turns were byte-exact. The
historical four one-frame boundary differences came from comparing the old
archive-default streaming geometry with the recommended profile, not from a
same-profile Rust/source loss. Same-host L6 tied-selection parity is resolved
by the pinned safe libc++ `nth_element` translation. This is parity evidence,
not broad corpus accuracy, greater-than-four-speaker capacity, cross-platform,
or broad accuracy certification evidence; the registry and focused diagnostic
command therefore report `development_uncertified`. The converted f32 package is
491,570,584 bytes
(SHA-256 `487fa30cb0aa9799c77bd9985e6787962c3991fab8d4d576a4f1221d45298f6a`).
Its distribution policy is `github_release_with_license_and_notice`: weights
remain outside Git and are attached to the dedicated model release with the
license, notice, and authenticated conversion receipt.
The default cache is `~/.cache/franken_whisper/models`; an override through
`FRANKEN_WHISPER_MODEL_DIR` must be absolute. Partially downloaded files retain
hidden staging names for diagnosis and are never admitted as model artifacts.
Speaker-hints JSON must be a bounded regular non-symlink file.
Full proof details and current performance/resource rows are in
[`SORTFORMER_RUST_PORT.md`](docs/SORTFORMER_RUST_PORT.md).
The external Sortformer adapter's version probe must bind the frozen contract
hash, independently verify that
the 471,367,680-byte local artifact hashes to the pinned Hugging Face LFS
SHA-256, and retain a path-free runtime fingerprint. The frozen evaluation row
is CPU-only float32 with autocast and quantization disabled, deterministic
algorithms enabled, zero data-loader workers, eight PyTorch intra-op threads,
and one inter-op thread. Output labels are arrival-ordered `speaker_0` through
`speaker_3`; a reference containing five or more speakers is retained as an
explicit model-capacity skip rather than being dropped or forced into four
labels. The external Python/NeMo oracle remains operator-installed. This is
separate from the native Rust runtime's explicit `fw pull sortformer` cache.
The full adapter protocol, environment overrides, privacy rules, and authority
boundary are in the
[`acoustic diarization contract`](docs/acoustic_diarization_contract.md#114-stage-aware-external-differential-oracles).

ReDimNet2-B2 is a separate compact speaker-embedding experiment, not an
end-to-end diarizer and not an `auto` route. The offline
`scripts/export_redimnet2.py` command accepts the pinned upstream checkpoint,
the exact v1.0.0 source tree, and a new output directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_redimnet2.py INPUT.pt SOURCE_ROOT OUTPUT_DIR
```

All three arguments must resolve outside this checkout, `OUTPUT_DIR` must not
exist, and the command performs no download. The exporter installs a Python
audit hook that denies socket and child-process events for the full conversion.
Its exporter and conversion-receipt schemas are v3; the synthetic truth tensor
contract remains v1. It requires Python 3.12.12 with
torch/torchaudio 2.7.1, NumPy 2.2.6, SciPy 1.15.3, and safetensors 0.5.3. It
hash-binds the 15,897,450-byte upstream checkpoint and 14 source files, rejects
every unmanifested regular file, symlink, bytecode file, or native extension in
the executable `redimnet2` package tree, disables bytecode writes, and refuses
preloaded ReDimNet modules. The receipt binds the interpreter binary, Python
implementation/cache tag, distribution RECORD/METADATA digests, and a
path-free commitment after verifying every hashed RECORD entry's bytes. It also
binds the Torch Git/build identity and build-configuration digest. It
drops only 68 scalar batch counters, and writes a metadata-free 15,745,544-byte
f32 package (SHA-256
`d41a729f5ef008d70c6d6bf4ab7ca27e299a478ff665665a4e31afff7f46ddeb`),
an 8,828,392-byte non-human synthetic seam pack (SHA-256
`21042537873c3dacafafd134d7c9e296318458f55f1a429c00bc9542f95f3238`),
and a canonical path-free receipt. Two final hardened v2 exports were
byte-identical; their immutable v2 receipt SHA-256 is
`e4e5aab1838dd386895425acc11e3405191e30ce2111c313c2734bfc2bccd77e`. The
model has 3,677,760 total parameters, of which 3,676,320 are trainable and 1,440
are frozen; its raw 192-vector is retained separately from consumer-side L2
normalization. Every manually captured terminal embedding must equal the real
upstream `forward` output bit-for-bit. Known upstream warnings and the one
pinned initialization message are captured and retained only as path-free
code/count/byte/digest records; any unknown warning or console output fails.
Publication uses a stable destination directory handle with no-follow,
create-exclusive files, inode checks, and
fsync. Those historical v2 receipts remain `operator_local_no_release`; they
are not relabeled by the v3 schema. The immutable v1.0.0 README identifies the
repository's official pretrained weights, links the exact release assets, and
declares MIT. Its source commit and GitHub release record predate the checkpoint
upload, so this is contemporaneous scope evidence rather than a later
retroactive inference. The exporter pins that README at SHA-256
`27d500b510a1cdc054a8ccbad484cf6062639fcb9d6b661714214fe766ed4e76` and
pins the later canonical 1,067-byte MIT payload at commit `2a8d15f65b1d`,
SHA-256 `3d5a4bf9936a7d09dd770588c0d7cb116fc16916a0310d71fb1fff5d64562101`.
Fresh v3 receipts therefore mark license scope resolved while keeping artifacts
`operator_local_pending_release_manifest`. A public raw or converted package
must still carry that exact license payload and notice and be bound by a
separate identity-checked release manifest before it may claim
`github_release_with_license_and_notice`. No ReDimNet weights, truth tensors,
feature values, local paths, audio, transcripts, or biometric vectors belong in
Git or public runtime reports. The historical package, truth, and v2 receipt
hashes above are not evidence that a fresh v3 receipt has been reproduced.

The two explicit Rust-native ECAPA modes run the pinned ECAPA-TDNN speaker
representation in process through the common segmentation, known-speaker
constraints, profile/count machinery, temporal UNKNOWN/overlap handling,
canonical labels, and transcript projection:

- `--diarization-engine ecapa` uses ECAPA embeddings for speaker identity and
  does not add acoustic channel evidence to pair scoring.
- `--diarization-engine ecapa-fused` authorizes ECAPA speaker identity plus
  bounded acoustic channel evidence and consensus. If no selected consensus
  merge joins a compatible pair with valid channel features, it conservatively reports generic consensus
  provenance instead. The library/JSON request spelling is `ecapa_fused`.

Both modes remain outside `auto`, and both are development-uncertified rather
than production-accuracy claims. Neither downloads a model: the exact
converted package must already resolve through the auxiliary model search
path. The library freezes and verifies the
license-compatible source revision, deterministic 200-tensor safetensors
package, exact package hash and metadata, a scalar conformance oracle, public
analytic golden stages, and fail-closed numerical tolerances. The bounded
safe-Rust runtime path implements a fixed-FFT periodic-Hamming PCM frontend,
TDNN/SE-Res2 aggregation, attentive statistics pooling, projection, and
embedding normalization on explicit FrankenTorch CPU kernels, with cooperative
cancellation, content-hash-validated process caching, and content-redacted
diagnostics. The package verifier reuses the native safetensors loader; no
parallel weight format or sidecar manifest is introduced. A
separately authenticated 2,160,320-byte public seven-stage oracle lets the
external conformance test compare all 539,616 frontend and neural `f32` values,
then recheck all 523,456 neural values through the composed Rust frontend, not
only selected checkpoints. Safe RAII logical-buffer leases enforce and report
the preplanned ECAPA-owned logical `f32` scratch-payload bound. Both generated
artifacts remain outside Git. The
project does not vendor weights or parse PyTorch checkpoints at runtime. The
current provider identity is
`ecapa-tdnn-voxceleb-cosine-v6-development`; the current clustering policy is
`acoustic-clustering-probabilistic-v20-channel-evidence-bound-fused-consensus-development`.
Reports distinguish the ECAPA-only `ecapa_spherical` partition from the
channel-aware five-lane `ecapa_fused_consensus` partition. The fused method is
  emitted only after at least one selected consensus merge joins a compatible
  ECAPA pair with valid channel features; otherwise the fused engine conservatively reports
generic `probabilistic_consensus` provenance and is ineligible for the
supported-profile redecode experiment. Cross-mode method claims fail
validation.
Its equal-loss different-speaker boundary is cosine distance `0.80`, and robust
final-assignment and held-out-validation separation begin at the same `0.80`.
Lane consensus and temporal recurrence may require stricter evidence, never a
hidden `0.70` gate. This is a versioned development decision bound, not an
accuracy-certification claim. Tracklets of at least two seconds use disjoint
discovery and held-out validation windows, each capped at three seconds;
shorter admitted tracklets use a discovery window, with sub-half-second input
zero-padded to the runtime minimum. Direct 192-dimensional cosine evidence is
marked development-uncertified;
failed public-development candidates remain negative evidence rather than
rollout authority. See the
[`ECAPA conformance boundary`](docs/acoustic_diarization_contract.md#115-optional-ecapa-model-and-numerical-conformance-boundary).

## YouTube Ingestion

`franken_whisper youtube run` downloads YouTube audio and transcribes each video into a clean, deep-linked **markdown + JSON** pair. Hand it individual video URLs, playlist URLs (auto-expanded to their videos), or a file of URLs — it downloads, transcribes, and writes one transcript per video into `youtube_transcripts/` (override with `--output-dir`). Because the transcription runs on the same engine as `transcribe`, this pairs naturally with the in-process native engine: **no cloud, no API keys, your audio never leaves the machine.**

```bash
# Single video
franken_whisper youtube run "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw" --model tiny.en

# Several videos at once
franken_whisper youtube run \
  "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_A" \
  "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_B" \
  --concurrency 4

# A whole playlist (expanded to its videos automatically)
franken_whisper youtube run "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxxxxxxx"

# A file with one URL per line (blank lines and #/;/] comments ignored)
franken_whisper youtube run --batch-file urls.txt --output-dir ./talks
```

URLs may be passed positionally or with repeated `--url` flags, and mixed freely with `--batch-file`. A `watch?v=X&list=Y` URL is treated as the **single video** `X`, not the surrounding playlist.

The same command group provides agent-oriented catalog helpers:
`franken_whisper youtube search <QUERY>` emits deduplicated JSON hits, and
`franken_whisper youtube enrich <TARGET>...` resolves full metadata for chosen
URLs or ids. Run each subcommand with `--help` for its focused flags.

### Output

Each video produces a markdown transcript and a JSON sidecar. The default slug style is `{upload_date}_{title}_{id}` with lowercase ASCII title text and an intact, case-preserved YouTube id; `--naming-style pretty` selects the historical `{upload_date} - {title} [{id}]` layout. The downloaded audio is kept under `audio/<id>.<ext>` (delete it automatically with `--no-keep-audio`), and a `.fw_youtube_manifest.json` state file tracks per-video progress.

The **JSON** sidecar carries the structured form — `video` metadata, `run` metadata, native `windows` decode evidence, and a flat `utterances` array (one record per segment with `start_sec` / `end_sec` / `text` / `confidence`, plus `speaker` when diarized). External subprocess backends emit an empty `windows` array; an in-process `native-v2` result must provide the complete typed window contract or rendering fails closed:

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `[URL]...` / `--url <U>` | — | Video or playlist URLs (positional or repeated `--url`) |
| `--batch-file <F>` | — | File with one URL per line (`#`/`;`/`]` comments and blanks ignored) |
| `--output-dir <DIR>` | `youtube_transcripts` | Destination for markdown, JSON, and `audio/` |
| `--model <M>` | backend-specific | Model name or path forwarded to the engine |
| `--language <L>` | auto-detect | Language hint (ISO 639-1) |
| `--backend <B>` | `auto` | `auto`, `whisper-cpp`, `insanely-fast`, `whisper-diarization` |
| `--diarize` | `true` | Explicitly retain the default speaker diarization stage |
| `--no-diarize` | `false` | Disable native speaker diarization |
| `--concurrency <N>` | `3` | Maximum concurrent downloads |
| `--batch-size <N>` | `0` | Bound videos per download/transcribe wave (`0` processes all in one wave) |
| `--naming-style <S>` | `slug` | `slug`, `pretty`, or ASCII-lossy `ascii` artifact names |
| `--no-keep-audio` | `false` | Delete each audio file after its transcript is written |
| `--no-retry` | `false` | Do not retry videos previously marked failed in the manifest |
| `--abort-on-error` | `false` | Stop scheduling later waves after a per-video failure |
| `--json-summary` | `false` | Emit the final run summary as JSON on stdout (for scripting) |
| `--robot` | `false` | Stream per-video NDJSON robot events (`youtube.*`, schema 1.1.0) on stdout |

### Idempotent & Resumable

The `.fw_youtube_manifest.json` makes terminal work idempotent: a re-run **skips videos already `done`** and **retries previously failed videos** (unless `--no-retry`). Incomplete intermediate work is recovered from either an explicit `downloaded` manifest state or a completed `audio/<id>.<ext>` artifact left between download and the terminal transition; partial files, symlinks, wrong ids, and paths outside the owned audio directory are rejected. **Ctrl+C cancels cleanly** — yt-dlp is killed, in-flight transcription aborts, and the manifest stays honest about what completed. By default a partial failure is recorded, emitted as `youtube.failed`, and the run continues; `--abort-on-error` stops scheduling later waves after a failure, while videos already running in the current wave may finish. Every robot run that gets past `youtube.run_start` funnels through exactly one terminal `youtube.run_complete` emission attempt.

### Requires `yt-dlp`

This subcommand orchestrates [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), which you install separately:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp        # macOS
pipx install yt-dlp        # cross-platform, isolated
pip install -U yt-dlp      # cross-platform
```

Point `franken_whisper` at a specific build with `FRANKEN_WHISPER_YTDLP_BIN=/path/to/yt-dlp` if it is not on `PATH`.

**Keep yt-dlp current.** YouTube changes its site frequently, and a stale
`yt-dlp` is a common cause of download failures. franken_whisper warns when the
resolved `yt-dlp` build is **more than 90 days old**. Update it with:

```bash
yt-dlp -U                       # update to the latest stable
yt-dlp --update-to nightly      # or track the nightly channel for the freshest fixes
```

franken_whisper deliberately downloads with the forgiving `bestaudio/best` format selector rather than a strict codec filter, so a slightly stale yt-dlp still succeeds in more cases — but when YouTube breakage does occur, updating yt-dlp is the first and usually the only step.

## Real-Time Streaming (`fw robot listen`)

`fw robot listen` is **true live streaming**: speak into a microphone (or pipe raw PCM / replay a WAV) and act on transcript events while the speaker is still talking. It is a separate driver from batch `robot run`, not a flag on it: batch robot mode streams sequenced *stage* events, but those events are buffered per stage and only reach stdout when each stage completes — time-to-first-text equals full-file latency. The live driver calls the native engine directly in a bounded rolling-buffer loop (capture → resample → VAD → step decode → emission policy → NDJSON), bypassing the 10-stage pipeline whose path-typed stages and fixed wall-clock budgets are structurally wrong for an unbounded session.

### Quickstart

```bash
# Live microphone -> agent-consumable NDJSON (default: tiny.en fast lane, AlignAtt policy)
fw robot listen | jq -r 'select(.event == "transcript.delta") | .text'

# No device needed: pipe any producer in as raw PCM (16 kHz mono s16le shown; rate/channels configurable)
ffmpeg -i stream.mp3 -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 - | fw robot listen --source stdin-pcm

# Deterministic replay of a WAV through the identical event contract
fw robot listen --source file-replay --input meeting.wav --realtime-pace
```

### The event contract (schema `1.1.0`)

One JSON object per line on stdout, explicitly flushed. Every event carries `schema_version`, a strictly increasing per-session `seq`, an RFC-3339 `ts`, and the session `run_id`. A live session IS a run: it never emits `run_start`/`run_complete`; a success stream ends with `listen.session_stats {final: true}`, a fatal error ends with `run_error`.

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `listen.session_start` | Session configuration echo: source, capture backend, device, models, policy, step cadence, VAD parameter snapshot |
| `speech_started` | VAD opened an utterance (`utterance_id`, monotonically increasing from 1; utterances never nest) |
| `transcript.delta` | **Append-only committed text** — concatenating an utterance's deltas yields its transcript; committed text is never rewritten by later events |
| `transcript.partial` | Mutable preview of the uncommitted tail (suppress with `--no-partials`; the first remedy for slow consumers) |
| `utterance_end` | The "act now" signal: full committed `text` (32 KiB cap with `text_truncated` flag; deltas always carry the full text), `delta_count`, close `reason` = `endpoint` \| `timeout` \| `max_len` \| `session_end` |
| `transcript.confirm` / `transcript.correct` | Quality-lane verdicts keyed by `utterance_id`; may arrive **after** their `utterance_end` (async confirm lane; never blocks the live lane) |
| `listen.warning` | Structured non-fatal degradation: `silent_input`, `capture_overrun`, `fallback_capture_backend`, `fast_model_fallback`, `quality_model_unavailable`, `confirm_lag`, `forced_trim`, `decode_behind`, `persist_degraded`, `endpoint_flush_timeout`, … |
| `listen.session_stats` | Liveness heartbeat (default every 30 s, silence included) and terminal stats: `ttft_ms`, `mean/p95_step_latency_ms`, `deltas`, `utterances`, `capture_overruns`, `policy_holdbacks`, confirm-lag p50/p95/max |
| `listen.controller` | Default-off `--adaptive` decision evidence: bounded cadence/holdback transition, Brier calibration, observation count, and deterministic-fallback status |

Lifecycle invariants (enforced by contract tests): every `speech_started` is matched by exactly one later `utterance_end` carrying the same `utterance_id`; an utterance whose decode commits nothing still closes with empty text (breath/cough triggers are normal, never errors); an utterance's deltas always precede its `utterance_end`; `seq` strictly increases across every event.

```text
speech_started ──► transcript.delta* ─────► utterance_end ──► transcript.confirm/correct?
  (VAD onset)       append-only commits +      (endpoint / timeout /    async quality lane,
                    mutable partial previews    max_len / session_end)   keyed by utterance_id
```

### Emission policies

- **`--policy alignatt` (default).** AlignAtt (Simul-Whisper / SimulStreaming): a segment commits once its tokens' alignment-head cross-attention sits at least `--alignatt-holdback-ms` (default 200 ms) behind the live audio edge. Mid-utterance deltas flow as soon as attention stops attending near the buffer edge. A quality gate holds all commits for steps with high no-speech probability or very low mean log-prob (counted in `policy_holdbacks`) so non-speech audio does not hallucinate committed text.
- **`--policy endpoint-commit`.** Zero-intelligence baseline: mutable partials every step, one committed delta when the utterance closes. Kept forever as the latency harness's control arm.
- **`--policy local-agreement`.** LocalAgreement-2 fallback (whisper_streaming, arXiv 2307.14743): commit only the segment-text prefix two consecutive decodes agree on. Model-agnostic insurance (needs no attention tap); never the default.

jfk-style single-sentence utterances close before policies can differ; continuous monologues (>12 s single utterance) are where AlignAtt separates from endpoint-commit.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--source` | `mic` | `mic` \| `stdin-pcm` \| `file-replay` |
| `--input` + `--realtime-pace` | — / off | WAV input for `file-replay`; pace at real time vs. as-fast-as-possible |
| `--capture-backend` / `--mic-device` | `auto` / system default | capture backend `auto`\|`cpal`\|`ffmpeg`; input device name |
| `--list-devices` | off | enumerate input devices as NDJSON and exit (metadata only; never triggers a TCC prompt) |
| `--fast-model` | auto | fast-lane model override (default tiny.en for `en`, multilingual tiny otherwise) |
| `--policy` / `--alignatt-holdback-ms` | `alignatt` / 200 | emission policy (above); AlignAtt danger-zone width |
| `--step-ms` / `--max-buffer-sec` | 300 / 12 | decode cadence; rolling buffer cap |
| `--adaptive` | off | adapt cadence and AlignAtt holdback within fixed bounds; Brier calibration failures deterministically restore configured values and emit `listen.controller` evidence |
| `--language` | detect-and-pin | ISO 639-1 hint |
| `--max-seconds` / `--max-utterance-sec` | 0 / 90 | session length cap (0 = unbounded); force-close long open speech |
| `--no-partials` | off | suppress mutable partial previews (first remedy for slow consumers) |
| `--stats-interval-sec` | 30 | `listen.session_stats` heartbeat interval (0 = final only) |
| `--no-context` / `--capture-buffer-sec` | off / 30 | disable prompt carry; capture ring capacity |
| `--no-vad`, `--vad-gate-db`, `--vad-min-speech-ms`, `--vad-endpoint-ms` | off, 9, 250, 600 | VAD gating and tuning |
| `--quality-model`, `--confirm-drain-sec`, `--confirm-queue-bound` | auto, 10, 4 | confirm-lane controls (above) |
| `--db` / `--no-persist` | `.franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3` / off | persistence store; disable persistence |
| `--stdin-rate` / `--stdin-channels` / `--stdin-format` | 16000 / 1 / s16le | stdin-pcm format |

Full semantics per flag: [`docs/realtime-streaming.md`](docs/realtime-streaming.md).

### Models and the quality-confirm lane

The fast lane runs a small resident model: `tiny.en` when `--language en`, multilingual `tiny` otherwise (detect-and-pin). Missing fast-lane packages fall back to the turbo model with a `fast_model_fallback` warning; provision them with `fw pull tiny` / `fw pull tiny-en`.

The confirm lane re-transcribes each closed utterance with a quality model in a background thread. `--quality-model auto` (default) enables it iff the large-v3-turbo package is installed AND the fast lane did not fall back to turbo (self-confirmation is meaningless); `none` disables it; an explicit spec is honored unless it names the effective fast model. Verdicts reuse the batch CorrectionTracker and surface as `transcript.confirm`/`transcript.correct`. The live lane never blocks on the quality lane: more than `--confirm-queue-bound` (default 4) unconfirmed utterances drops the oldest with a `confirm_lag` warning, and session end waits at most `--confirm-drain-sec` (default 10) before a `confirm_drain_timeout` warning.

### Persistence

Sessions persist to SQLite by default (`--db`, default `.franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3`; disable with `--no-persist`) as ONE run row with backend `native-listen`, durability advancing at UTTERANCE granularity inside savepoint transactions. Mutable `transcript.partial` previews are deliberately NOT persisted (unlike batch, where every event is kept). A crashed session is recognizable as a listen run lacking its session-end marker; `runs.finished_at` is bumped at each flush as "last known alive".

### Latency expectations (measured, not aspirational)

From the first streaming latency campaign (`examples/listen_latency_ab.rs`, release build, `--source stdin-pcm`, paced 20 ms PCM injection; PERF_LEDGER 2026-08-23, bd-rt-latency-harness-3dkh, artifact `docs/perf_artifacts/listen_latency_campaign1_2026-08-23.json`) on a **loaded shared host** (load average ≈28–43):

- TTFT (first `transcript.delta` minus speech-onset injection): medians 3.1–5.6 s across fixtures — dominated by model load + first decode under contention, not steady-state stepping.
- Commit lag p50: ~0.79–1.21 s behind the audio being committed.
- Partial cadence: inter-partial p50 489 ms against `--step-ms 300` (cadence = step interval + decode time).
- Retraction count: 0 by construction (append-only deltas). Joined delta text was identical across policy arms on every fixture; the tone-only negative fixture produced zero output.

Honesty note: that campaign's A/A nulls missed the pre-declared band (host load), so it banks NO cross-policy comparison — quiet-host reruns can. Do not quote these rows as comparative wins; they are self-relative observations under load.

Live sessions transcribe only: speaker diarization is not part of the live driver (attribution stays a batch/post-hoc feature), and the fast lane decodes greedy-only (AlignAtt requires the attention tap, which fails requests with beam > 1).

### Agent integration

**Python:**

```python
import json, sys, subprocess

proc = subprocess.Popen(
    ["fw", "robot", "listen", "--source", "stdin-pcm"],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
)
for line in proc.stdout:
    event = json.loads(line)
    if event["event"] == "transcript.delta":
        print("COMMIT:", event["text"])           # append-only: safe to persist
    elif event["event"] == "utterance_end":
        print("ACT ON UTTERANCE:", event["text"]) # complete turn, act now
    elif event["event"] == "listen.warning":
        print("DEGRADED:", event["reason"], file=sys.stderr)
    elif event["event"] == "listen.session_stats" and event.get("final"):
        break
```

**Node.js:**

```javascript
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";
import readline from "node:readline";

const proc = spawn("fw", ["robot", "listen"]);
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: proc.stdout });
for await (const line of rl) {
  const event = JSON.parse(line);
  if (event.event === "transcript.delta") console.log("COMMIT:", event.text);
  if (event.event === "utterance_end") console.log("ACT ON UTTERANCE:", event.text);
  if (event.event === "listen.session_stats" && event.final) break;
}
```

Key on `transcript.delta` for durable state (it never changes after arrival) and `utterance_end` for turn-taking actions (answering, tool calls). Treat `transcript.partial` as ephemeral display garnish. Full architecture, design rationale, tunables, and failure-mode tables: [`docs/realtime-streaming.md`](docs/realtime-streaming.md).

## Command Reference

`franken_whisper` exposes ten top-level subcommands.

### `transcribe`

Core transcription command. Runs ingest, normalization, native Whisper,
native speaker diarization, optional alignment/punctuation stages, and
persistence. Use `--no-diarize` for transcript-only work.

```bash
franken_whisper transcribe [OPTIONS]
```

|------|---------|-------------|
| `--db <PATH>` | `.franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3` | SQLite database path |
| `--no-persist` | `false` | Skip persistence entirely |
| `--timeout <SEC>` | — | Overall pipeline deadline (seconds) |

**Inference Tuning (whisper.cpp):**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--threads <N>` | 4 | Computation threads |
| `--processors <N>` | 1 | Parallel processors |
| `--no-gpu` | `false` | Force CPU-only |
| `--beam-size <N>` | 5 | Beam search width |
| `--best-of <N>` | 5 | Sampling candidates |
| `--temperature <F>` | 0.0 | Sampling temperature |
| `--temperature-increment <F>` | — | Temperature fallback increment |
| `--entropy-threshold <F>` | — | Entropy threshold for fallback |
| `--logprob-threshold <F>` | — | Log-probability threshold |
| `--no-speech-threshold <F>` | — | No-speech probability threshold |

| `--prompt <TEXT>` | — | Initial prompt to guide transcription style |
| `--carry-initial-prompt` | `false` | Carry prompt across segments |

**Audio Windowing (whisper.cpp):**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--offset-ms <N>` | 0 | Start transcription at offset (ms); honored by the native engine (PCM sliced before decode) and the whisper.cpp bridge (`-ot`). Emitted timestamps stay in source-file time |
| `--duration-ms <N>` | — | Transcribe only this duration (ms); wall-clock scales with the slice. Backends that cannot honor the window record it in `warnings` |
| `--audio-ctx <N>` | — | Audio context size (tokens) |
| `--word-threshold <F>` | — | Per-word confidence threshold (drop words below) |
| `--suppress-regex <REGEX>` | — | Suppress tokens matching regex |

Word-level timestamp *extraction* (max-len, token-threshold, token-sum-threshold) is exposed through the `WordTimestampParams` struct via the library API; the bridge parser already extracts nested `words` arrays from `whisper.cpp` output when those parameters are set programmatically.

**VAD (Voice Activity Detection):**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--vad` | Enable Voice Activity Detection |
| `--vad-model <PATH>` | Custom VAD model path |

| `--vad-min-silence-ms <N>` | Minimum silence duration (ms) |
| `--vad-max-speech-s <F>` | Maximum speech duration (seconds) |
| `--vad-speech-pad-ms <N>` | Speech padding (ms) |

**Batching (insanely-fast-whisper):**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--batch-size <N>` | 24 | Parallel inference batch size |

| `--flash-attention` | `false` | Enable Flash Attention 2 |
| `--hf-token <TOKEN>` | env | HuggingFace token for diarization |
| `--timestamp-level` | `chunk` | `chunk` or `word` granularity |
| `--transcript-path <PATH>` | — | Override transcript output path |

**Diarization:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--diarization-engine <ENGINE>` | `auto` | `auto` selects native Sortformer; alternatives are `sortformer`, `acoustic`, `external`, `ecapa`, and `ecapa-fused` |
| `--diarization-fallback <POLICY>` | `acoustic` | `unknown`, `acoustic`, `external`, or `error`; the default handles missing/capacity-ineligible Sortformer evidence in Rust |
| `--speaker-hints <PATH>` | — | Read a `speaker-hints-v1` document in place; the path is not retained, but parsed fields persist with the run unless `--no-persist` is used |
| `--enrollment-edge-guard-ms <N>` | `100` | Remove boundary-adjacent audio before enrolling a known interval |
| `--diarization-max-prototypes <N>` | `512` | Bounded global native-diarization prototype cap (`1..=512`) |
| `--persist-speaker-profiles` | `false` | Record explicit persistence consent; schema v6 still stores privacy-safe summaries rather than reusable acoustic vectors |
| `--speaker-count-hard <K>` | — | Explicit hard search constraint; success still requires independent evidence for every speaker and uncertain speech remains UNKNOWN |
| `--speaker-count-range <MIN..MAX>` | — | Soft bounded count preference; native evidence may disagree or remain unresolved |
| `--speaker-count-prior <PRIOR>` | — | Soft point prior (`K`) or normalized distribution (`K=P,K=P`); never forces occupancy |
| `--no-stem` | `false` | Disable external-backend vocal isolation |
| `--suppress-numerals` | `false` | Spell out numbers for external alignment stability |
| `--diarization-model <MODEL>` | — | Override the external diarization model |

ECAPA fallback is deliberately asymmetric so a missing external result is not
mistaken for successful fallback:

| Policy | ECAPA ran, but evidence is insufficient | ECAPA package/load/inference unavailable |
|---|---|---|
| `unknown` | Retain the native result, hard-hint assignments, and UNKNOWN where evidence is insufficient | Emit hard hints where possible and UNKNOWN elsewhere under `native-ecapa-unavailable-v1` |
| `acoustic` | Rerun the common stack with acoustic-v2 speaker identity while retaining ECAPA provenance | Rerun acoustic identity and attach an unavailable-ECAPA summary |
| `external` | Use valid external labels when present; otherwise retain the insufficient ECAPA result | Use valid external labels when present; otherwise return an error |
| `error` | Return an inner-diarizer error | Return an error |

**Speculative Streaming:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--speculative` | `false` | Enable dual-model speculative cancel-correct mode |
| `--fast-model <MODEL>` | — | Fast model for low-latency partial transcripts |
| `--quality-model <MODEL>` | — | Quality model for correction / verification |
| `--speculative-window-ms <N>` | 3000 | Sliding window size (ms) |
| `--speculative-overlap-ms <N>` | 500 | Window overlap (ms) |
| `--correction-tolerance-wer <F>` | — | WER tolerance for confirmation vs. retraction |
| `--no-adaptive` | `false` | Disable adaptive window sizing |
| `--always-correct` | `false` | Force quality model on every window (evaluation mode) |

### `diarization-corpus`

External-only preparation and aggregate evaluation for public or
operator-licensed diarization corpora. The registry does not download data or
accept a license on the operator's behalf.

`registry` is available on every supported CLI target. The artifact-writing
`prepare-voxconverse`, `build`, `ablate`, `sidecar-study`, and `compare-models`
commands require Linux, Android, or an Apple platform; Windows and other targets return
`public_corpus.output_platform` before reading corpus media or annotations.

The VoxConverse adapter preserves original file hashes and applies one narrow,
evidenced geometry normalization in memory: an official turn that starts before
WAV EOF may be clipped when it overruns EOF by at most 100 ms. The preparation
receipt and bundle retain clipped-turn and clipped-millisecond counts; larger
overruns and turns beginning at EOF fail closed.

`compare-models` is a development-only, diagnostic comparison of
`native_acoustic`, `native_ecapa`, `native_ecapa_fused`, `native_sortformer`,
and `external_sortformer`. It infers speaker count, fixes native and Sortformer CPU
worker counts at eight, and applies the same frozen 1800-second attempt timeout
to every lane. The application downloads neither the ECAPA
package nor the external Sortformer adapter/model; the native Sortformer lane
uses the release-bound cache installed by the installer or `fw pull sortformer`. Absent
components become typed lane skips. Protocol v6 pins the complete effective native request
for each lane, its ordered payload-free outcome taxonomy, and its own canonical
digest. Any change to those bindings requires a new version-and-digest pair.

The comparison evidence is aggregate-only and cannot authorize a superiority
or production-routing claim. Every lane/observation runs in a fresh process
under the balanced Williams order. The worker rechecks the executable, audio,
normalized PCM, reference, scorer, protocol, and applicable model artifact
identities. Parent-observed wall time includes process launch, bounded IPC,
worker identity validation, audio decode, model load, inference, output
validation, scoring, parent-side post-run identity validation, and the native
platform resource probe. The parent kills the complete descendant process
group on cancellation or timeout, records a live recursive-descendant
cancellation probe through the same bounded observer path used by real lanes.
Cancellation, timeout, and output-limit checks run before observation. On Unix,
cleanup reaps the root and verifies that the owned process group is absent;
cleanup failure overrides a nominal success, cancellation, or timeout. An
initial group-signal error is accepted only when the subsequent absence probe
still certifies that the complete group is gone. Before
reading its request, the worker opens an inherited kernel-pipe capability bound
to its direct parent and starts a liveness watcher. Abrupt parent death closes
the sole write end, causing the worker to terminate its complete process group;
unsupported platforms fail before launching an observed worker. The RSS
field is an approximate sampled maximum of the concurrent process-group sum,
including nested subprocess adapters. Sample starts are no closer than 50 ms,
and each platform probe has its own fixed bound; this is not an exact process
high-water mark or a promise of exactly 50 ms between samples. A worker that
exits before any sample is explicitly unavailable, while repeated disappearance
of a still-live group fails the resource probe. The platform scan checks both
cancellation and the enclosing attempt deadline. A matched live Linux group
member cannot be silently omitted: every such member must expose a valid RSS
field. A complete zero-only scan is treated as a missing sample, never as a
measured zero, and repeated zero-only observations fail closed. Wall time, RTF,
sampled whole-tree RSS, and cancellation latency carry explicit scope,
authority, and cap dispositions rather than zero or shared-process estimates.
The companion path-free public bundle is record-level scorer input and therefore
retains opaque public recording/speaker IDs and reference timestamps, but no
source path, filename, audio, or transcript.

`verify_public_model_comparison_bundle_identity_pair` validates both retained
artifacts and proves that their corpus, source, descriptor, bundle, split, and
recording-count identities agree. Because the evidence is aggregate-only, this
API does not derive its observation-set commitment or metrics from the bundle;
that stronger proof still requires source reconstruction and a fresh run.

All path arguments must be absolute. Entire output file names must use lowercase
ASCII letters, digits, period, underscore, and hyphen and end in the exact
suffix `.json`; a handle-relative preflight also rejects an existing
ASCII-case-fold sibling, making ordinary case-sensitive and case-insensitive
collisions fail consistently. Exact-name no-clobber publication remains the
atomic creation guard. Input data must
remain outside the checkout, and bundle/evidence parents must be outside both
the checkout and input root. Outputs use create-new semantics and are never overwritten. On
Linux, Android, and Apple platforms, complete JSON is privately staged relative
to an identity-bound directory handle and atomically published with no-clobber
semantics. The terminal parent may not be a symlink; it must be owned by the
effective user and not group/world writable. This protects handle-relative
directory contents while treating the effective user as trusted, because that
user can also alter a final artifact afterward. Requested and canonical
terminal-directory identities are checked throughout. Ancestor rename
authority, ACLs, privileged mount changes, and arbitrary mount aliases of a
checkout/input descendant are outside this boundary; use a privately controlled
output path and filesystem without broader ACL access. Other platforms fail
closed for this public-artifact path. Add
`--maximum-recording-duration-ms <N>` to freeze a deterministic prefix. A
pre-publication failure creates no final-name artifact and never modifies an
existing final-name entry. After permission verification, later failures
truncate and synchronize the private staging inode to a zero-length mode-0600
marker; this is not a secure block erase. Creation is followed by an explicit
mode-0600 permission operation and verification that the inode is a regular
file owned by the effective user with exactly those access bits; failure is
reported before payload serialization. POSIX/NFSv4 ACLs and mount policies
that grant access beyond Unix mode bits are outside this writer's authority, so
public-artifact output directories must reside on a filesystem where such
broader access is absent. A permission-establishment failure leaves an empty
marker but makes no mode claim. A storage failure during a payload scrub reports
`public_corpus.output_cleanup_uncertain`. An error after the
no-clobber rename is reported as
`public_corpus.output_commit_uncertain`, because the final artifact may already
exist and is not truncated. An ambiguous rename error uses the same
commit-uncertain result and conservatively preserves the held inode; only an
authoritative no-clobber conflict is treated as definitely pre-commit. Bundle
and evidence files are each published
atomically, but their two renames are not a cross-file transaction; successful
evidence publication is the completion signal for the pair. A
sidecar certification run uses `--stage certification` and must also supply
`--locked-development-evidence <PATH>`; it evaluates the unfused baseline and
only the single candidate selected by the exact locked development artifact.
Both stages parse and hash the complete descriptor and audit its path-free
cross-split metadata, but materialize WAV, RTTM, and optional word-annotation
bytes only for the stage's selected split. Certification validates the retained
development artifact's complete internal contract—including both calibration
fingerprints and provenance, selected lane, recomputed gates/ranking/disposition,
and result/accuracy hashes—then binds the current descriptor and protocol before
opening held-out inputs. This validation does not refit calibration or replay
development audio. Development and certification
therefore create distinct split-specific bundle hashes; the shared descriptor
and protocol hashes are the cross-stage lock.
Source paths, filenames, recording/speaker identifiers, per-recording
observations, feature values, audio, and transcripts never enter the aggregate
study evidence.

### `robot`

Agent-first interface with structured NDJSON output and a stable schema contract.

```bash
# streaming transcription with stage events
franken_whisper robot run [TRANSCRIBE_OPTIONS]

# live microphone / pipe streaming (see "Real-Time Streaming" section)
franken_whisper robot listen [--source mic|stdin-pcm|file-replay ...]

# emit the full JSON schema for every event type
franken_whisper robot schema

# discover backends and capabilities
franken_whisper robot backends

# system health diagnostics (backends, ffmpeg, database, resources)
franken_whisper robot health

# query routing decision history
franken_whisper robot routing-history [--run-id <ID>] [--limit 20]
```

**Robot Event Catalog (schema `1.1.0`; the six core `listen.*` / speech-lifecycle events and the optional adaptive-controller event are additive members of the same contract):**

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `run_start` | Request accepted, pipeline starting |
| `stage` | Pipeline stage progress (sequenced, timestamped) |
| `run_complete` | Transcription finished with full result |
| `run_error` | Pipeline failed with structured error code |
| `backends.discovery` | Backend availability + per-backend capabilities |
| `routing_decision` | Backend routing decision with posterior snapshot and evidence |
| `health.report` | System health (backend / ffmpeg / DB / resource status) |
| `transcript.partial` | Speculative fast-model partial transcript (immediate) |
| `transcript.confirm` | Quality model confirms partial (drift within tolerance) |
| `transcript.retract` | Quality model retracts partial (drift exceeds tolerance) |
| `transcript.correct` | Quality model correction with corrected segments |
| `transcript.speculation_stats` | Aggregate speculation pipeline statistics |
| `listen.session_start` | Live session configuration echo (additive 1.1.0 family; a session never emits `run_start`/`run_complete`) |
| `speech_started` | VAD opened an utterance (`utterance_id` from 1, never nested) |
| `transcript.delta` | Append-only committed text for the live driver (concatenating deltas = the utterance transcript) |
| `utterance_end` | Utterance closed: full committed text (32 KiB cap + `text_truncated`), `delta_count`, close reason |
| `listen.warning` | Structured non-fatal degradation (`confirm_lag`, `forced_trim`, `capture_overrun`, …) |
| `listen.session_stats` | Heartbeat + terminal session stats (`ttft_ms`, step latencies, confirm-lag percentiles; `final:true` ends a success stream) |
| `listen.controller` | Default-off adaptive cadence/holdback decision with state transition, Brier calibration, observation count, and deterministic-fallback status |
| `youtube.run_start` / `youtube.run_complete` | YouTube ingestion request envelope and exactly-one terminal aggregate summary |
| `youtube.discovered` | Resolved video identity, title, and URL |
| `youtube.downloading` / `youtube.downloaded` | Per-video download lifecycle and resulting local audio artifact metadata |
| `youtube.transcribing` / `youtube.done` | Per-video native transcription start and written Markdown/JSON artifact summary |
| `youtube.skipped` / `youtube.failed` | Explicit terminal disposition for an unprocessed or failed video |

**Stage Codes.** Each pipeline stage emits paired `*.start` / `*.ok` codes (or `*.error` on failure, `*.skip` when not needed, `*.cancelled` on token fire, `*.timeout` on budget overrun):

`ingest.start`, `ingest.ok`, `normalize.start`, `normalize.ok`, `vad.start`, `vad.ok`, `separate.start`, `separate.ok`, `backend.start`, `backend.ok`, `backend.routing.decision_contract`, `backend.dropped_windows`, `acceleration.start`, `acceleration.ok`, `align.start`, `align.ok`, `punctuate.start`, `punctuate.ok`, `diarize.rollout`, `diarize.start`, `diarize.ok`, `persist.start`, `persist.ok`, `orchestration.budgets`, `orchestration.latency_profile`

`backend.dropped_windows` fires when the native engine discards a long-form
decode window without emitting a transcript; the same drop is recorded in
`result.raw_output.dropped_windows` and in the run's `warnings`, so a content
gap is never stderr-only.

**Health Report.** `robot health` probes every subsystem and returns a structured diagnostic:

```json
{
  "event": "health.report",
  "schema_version": "1.1.0",
  "ts": "2026-04-25T00:00:00Z",
  "backends": [
    {"name": "whisper.cpp", "available": true, "path": "/usr/local/bin/whisper-cli", "version": "1.7.2", "issues": []}
  ],
  "ffmpeg": {"name": "ffmpeg", "available": true, "path": "/usr/bin/ffmpeg", "version": null, "issues": []},
  "database": {"name": "database", "available": true, "path": ".franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3", "version": "schema_v4", "issues": []},
  "resources": {"disk_free_bytes": 12345, "disk_total_bytes": 67890, "memory_available_bytes": 11111, "memory_total_bytes": 22222},
  "overall_status": "ok"
}
```

### `runs`

Query persisted run history.

```bash
franken_whisper runs [--limit 20] [--format plain|json|ndjson] [--id <RUN_ID>]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--limit <N>` | 20 | Max recent runs |
| `--format` | `plain` | `plain` (table), `json` (pretty), `ndjson` (streaming) |
| `--id <UUID>` | — | Fetch a specific run by ID |

### `sync`

One-way JSONL snapshot export / import with distributed lock safety.

```bash
# full export to JSONL
franken_whisper sync export-jsonl --output ./snapshot [--db <PATH>] [--state-root <PATH>]

# import with a conflict policy
franken_whisper sync import-jsonl --input ./snapshot \
  --conflict-policy reject|skip|overwrite|overwrite-strict \
  [--db <PATH>] [--state-root <PATH>]
```

An export produces `runs.jsonl`, `segments.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`, and `manifest.json` (with row counts and SHA-256 checksums). Import automatically runs `validate_sync()` after the row inserts and reports `validation_ok` plus per-table count comparison in the result JSON.

**Library-level capabilities** that are not yet exposed at the CLI:

- `sync::export_incremental()`: cursor-based delta export (uses `sync_cursor.json`)
- `sync::compress_jsonl()` / `sync::decompress_jsonl()`: gzip-compress or decompress a JSONL file. The import path transparently reads `*.jsonl.gz` when present.
- `sync::validate_sync()`: standalone validation function (auto-called on import, callable directly from the library)

### `tty-audio`

Low-bandwidth audio transport over TTY/PTY links using the `mulaw+zlib+b64` NDJSON protocol.

```bash
# encode audio to NDJSON frames
franken_whisper tty-audio encode --input audio.wav [--chunk-ms 200]

# decode NDJSON frames to WAV
cat frames.ndjson | franken_whisper tty-audio decode --output restored.wav \
  [--recovery fail_closed|skip_missing]

# generate a retransmit plan from a lossy stream
cat frames.ndjson | franken_whisper tty-audio retransmit-plan

# emit individual control frames
franken_whisper tty-audio control handshake
franken_whisper tty-audio control ack --up-to-seq 42
franken_whisper tty-audio control backpressure --remaining-capacity 64
franken_whisper tty-audio control retransmit-request --sequences 1,2,4
franken_whisper tty-audio control retransmit-response --sequences 1,2,4

# automated retransmit loop with strategy escalation
cat frames.ndjson | franken_whisper tty-audio control retransmit-loop --rounds 3

# convenience shorthands
franken_whisper tty-audio send-control handshake|eof|reset
cat frames.ndjson | franken_whisper tty-audio retransmit --rounds 3
```

**Recovery Strategy Escalation.** The retransmit loop escalates across rounds:

```
Simple (1 frame/round) → Redundant (2 frames/round) → Escalate (4 frames/round)
```

**Integrity Checks.** Every frame optionally carries CRC32 and SHA-256 hashes of the raw (pre-compression) audio. Mismatches drop the frame (`skip_missing`) or fail the stream (`fail_closed`).

Full protocol spec: [`docs/tty-audio-protocol.md`](docs/tty-audio-protocol.md). Determinism guarantees: [`docs/tty-replay-guarantees.md`](docs/tty-replay-guarantees.md).

### `tui`

Interactive terminal UI for human operators (feature-gated; requires `--features tui`).

```bash
franken_whisper --features tui tui     # when invoked via cargo run
```

**Features:**

- Live transcription view with auto-scroll
- Speaker labels, timestamps, and confidence scores per segment
- Browsable run history with timing and backend info
- Timeline view of pipeline stages with duration bars
- Event detail panes for individual NDJSON events
- Segment retention cap (10,000 segments, oldest-first drain)
- Vim-style keybindings; focus cycling between panes

Built on the [FrankenTUI](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentui) framework.

| `XDG_STATE_HOME` | `$HOME/.local/state` | Base for auto-provisioned ffmpeg + per-user tool state |
| `RUST_LOG` | — | tracing filter (e.g. `franken_whisper=debug`) |

**Per-stage budget overrides.** Every pipeline stage has an independent millisecond budget overridable via environment variable:

`FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_INGEST_MS`, `…NORMALIZE_MS`, `…PROBE_MS`, `…VAD_MS`, `…SEPARATE_MS`, `…BACKEND_MS`, `…ACCELERATION_MS`, `…ALIGN_MS`, `…PUNCTUATE_MS`, `…DIARIZE_MS`, `…PERSIST_MS`, `…CLEANUP_MS`.

### Cargo Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tui` | Enable the interactive TUI via `ftui` |
| `fj-oracle` | Enable the FrankenJAX differential conformance oracle tests; not a production acceleration backend |

No features are enabled by default. FrankenTorch CPU kernels and the macOS-only
Metal dependency are target-selected implementation details, not optional
features.

### Backend Routing

The `auto` backend retains its adaptive Bayesian family decision contract, but
the default `sole` rollout executes the selected family through its native Rust
implementation. Bridge commands are opt-in compatibility paths.

**Non-diarization priority (deterministic fallback):** `whisper_cpp` → `insanely_fast` → `whisper_diarization`
**Diarization priority (deterministic fallback):** `insanely_fast` → `whisper_diarization` → `whisper_cpp`

Each `auto` run emits a `backend.routing.decision_contract` stage event containing explicit state / action / loss / posterior / calibration terms. When the calibration score drops below 0.3, the Brier score exceeds 0.35, or fewer than 5 observations are available, the router falls back to the deterministic priority list above.

### Native Engine Rollout

Native Rust engine replacements follow a 5-stage rollout under conformance gating:

| Stage | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `shadow` | Deterministic bridge execution only; native conformance validated out-of-band |
| `validated` | Deterministic bridge execution only with stricter conformance gating |
| `fallback` | Deterministic bridge execution only; fallback policy and evidence paths hardened |
| `primary` | Native preferred with deterministic bridge fallback |
| `sole` | Native only (**default**) |

The execution-path metadata on every `backend.ok` event and replay envelope records the active stage so post-hoc analysis can correlate output drift with rollout transitions.

`auto` diarization resolves to the native Sortformer engine. If the verified
package is unavailable, known-speaker intervals require identity mapping, or a
count request exceeds four lanes, the default `acoustic` policy runs the
bounded Rust acoustic engine. Explicit engine selection remains available.
Every run emits `diarize.rollout` with the requested and resolved engine,
configuration validity, and fallback evidence.

### Data Flow

1. **Ingest**: materialize input from file, stdin, or mic capture
2. **Normalize**: convert to 16 kHz mono WAV via the built-in Rust decoder (`ffmpeg` fallback for video and exotic formats)
3. **VAD** *(optional)*: Voice Activity Detection skips silence
4. **Source Separate** *(optional)*: vocal isolation for cleaner transcription
5. **Backend**: dispatch to the selected engine (adaptive routing or explicit)
6. **Accelerate** *(optional)*: bounded, numerically stable confidence normalization
7. **Alignment** *(optional)*: forced alignment for word-level timestamps
8. **Punctuation** *(optional)*: punctuation restoration
9. **Diarization** *(optional)*: speaker identification and labeling
10. **Persist**: write run report, segments, and events to SQLite

Every stage emits `*.start` and `*.ok` events to the NDJSON stream with sequence numbers, RFC-3339 timestamps, and structured payloads. Skipped stages emit `*.skip` so agents can distinguish "not needed" from "failed."

## Technical Details

### Bayesian Backend Router

When `--backend auto` is selected, `franken_whisper` runs a formal Bayesian decision contract rather than trying backends in a fixed order.

**State Space (3 states):**
- `all_available`: all three backends found on PATH and responsive
- `partial_available`: 1–2 backends operational
- `none_available`: nothing usable

**Action Space (4 actions):**
- `try_whisper_cpp`, `try_insanely_fast`, `try_diarization` (reordered per request based on `--diarize`)
- `fallback_error`: return a structured error when nothing is available

**Loss Matrix.** The router builds a 3×4 loss matrix (states × actions). Each cell aggregates three weighted factors:

```
cost = (0.45 × latency_cost) + (0.35 × quality_cost) + (0.20 × failure_cost)
```

- **Latency cost** scales with audio duration (short / medium / long buckets) and a per-backend latency proxy
- **Quality cost** depends on backend capability relative to the request (diarization support, GPU availability)
- **Failure cost** is `(1.0 − p_success) × 100`, where `p_success` comes from the Bayesian posterior

**Bayesian Posterior.** Each backend starts with a Beta prior reflecting expected reliability:

| Backend | Prior | Prior mean |
|---------|-------|------------|
| `whisper_cpp` | `Beta(7, 3)` | 0.70 |
| `insanely_fast` | `Beta(6, 4)` | 0.60 |
| `whisper_diarization` | `Beta(5, 5)` | 0.50 |

After each run the posterior is updated with the observed outcome (success / failure).

**Latency Proxy Model.** Backend latency is estimated as a function of audio duration:

```
latency_cost = base + (sqrt(audio_duration_seconds) × multiplier)
```

| Backend | Base (s) | Multiplier (normal) | Multiplier (diarize) |
|---------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `whisper_cpp` | 12.0 | 1.0 | 1.25 |
| `insanely_fast` | 8.0 | 1.0 | 1.25 |
| `whisper_diarization` | 18.0 | 1.0 | 1.25 |

When at least 5 empirical observations are available the estimate blends prior and empirical:
`(0.6 × prior_latency) + (0.4 × empirical_latency)`.

**Quality Proxy Model.** Each backend has a quality score that varies with whether diarization is requested:

| Backend | Quality (normal) | Quality (diarize) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| `whisper_cpp` | 0.84 | 0.55 |
| `insanely_fast` | 0.80 | 0.82 |
| `whisper_diarization` | 0.63 | 0.88 |

`p_success = (α + quality_score × 2.0 + diarize_boost) / (α + β + quality_terms + penalty_terms)`.

A backend with a strong empirical track record can still be penalized when it lacks a capability the request needs (for example, `whisper_cpp` receiving a diarization request).

**Availability Penalties.** The loss matrix applies sharp penalties when backends are unavailable, dominating the loss calculation so the router never selects an unavailable backend even if its quality/latency profile is attractive.

**Policy Versioning.** The routing policy carries an identifier (`backend-selection-v1.0`). Every evidence-ledger entry includes a `loss_matrix_hash` so post-hoc analysis can detect when the policy weights themselves changed between runs.

**Calibration & Fallback.** The router tracks a sliding window of **50** prediction-outcome pairs and computes a Brier score. It falls back to deterministic static priority when any of these hold:

- fewer than 5 observations (insufficient data),
- calibration score < 0.3 (posterior margin too narrow),
- Brier score > 0.35 (predictions don't match reality).

The fallback path **still records the adaptive prediction it would have made** so calibration data continues accumulating even when the static policy is driving the routing. Once calibration improves, the system can recover automatically.

**Evidence Ledger.** Every routing decision is recorded in a circular buffer (capacity: **200** entries) containing the decision ID, trace ID, observed state, chosen action, posterior snapshot, calibration metrics, and fallback flag. Queryable via `robot routing-history`.

### Pipeline Stage Budgets

Each stage runs under an independent millisecond budget. Defaults:

| Stage / Knob | Budget | Rationale |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Ingest | 15 s | File I/O or mic capture |
| Normalize | 180 s | Audio decode + resample |
| VAD | 10 s | Lightweight energy detection |
| Source Separate | 30 s | Demucs-style vocal isolation |
| Backend | 900 s (15 min) | Full inference (long audio on CPU) |
| Acceleration | 20 s | CPU confidence mass normalization |
| Align | 30 s | CTC forced alignment |
| Punctuate | 10 s | Punctuation model inference |
| Diarize | 30 s | Speaker clustering |
| Persist | 20 s | SQLite transaction |
| Probe *(internal)* | 8 s | Backend / ffmpeg / database probing before pipeline starts |
| Cleanup *(internal)* | 5 s | Finalizer total budget |

All 12 budgets are overridable via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_<NAME>_MS`. For example, `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_BACKEND_MS=1800000` extends the backend stage to 30 minutes. `Probe` and `Cleanup` are tunable knobs without user-visible `PipelineStage` enum variants; they govern pre-pipeline health checks and post-pipeline finalizer execution respectively.

**Automatic Latency Profiling.** After each run, the orchestrator emits an `orchestration.latency_profile` stage event with per-stage timing decomposition. Each stage gets a utilization ratio (`service_ms / budget_ms`) and a tuning recommendation:

| Utilization | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| ≤ 30% | `decrease_budget_candidate` |
| 30–90% | `keep_budget` |
| ≥ 90% | `increase_budget` (suggest 1.25× current) |

### Replay Envelopes & Drift Detection

Every completed run produces a `ReplayEnvelope` containing SHA-256 hashes:

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
|               ReplayEnvelope                    |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| input_content_hash:  SHA-256(normalized WAV)    |
| backend_identity:    "whisper-cli-v1.7.2"       |
| backend_version:     "1.7.2"                    |
| output_payload_hash: SHA-256(raw backend JSON)  |
| native_rollout_stage: "sole"    | …             |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

Given identical input audio and the same backend version, the output hash should be identical. If it changes between runs, something drifted; the conformance harness can pinpoint whether the drift came from the backend, the native engine rollout, or audio normalization.

### Replay Packs

Self-contained **replay packs** capture everything needed to reproduce and analyze a run:

```
replay_pack/
  env.json                # EnvSnapshot:    OS, arch, backend identity/version, fw version
  manifest.json           # PackManifest:   trace_id, run_id, timestamps, content hashes
  repro.lock              # ReproLock:      routing evidence, replay envelope, request params
  tolerance_manifest.json # ToleranceManifest: schema version, timestamp tolerance
```

| File | Struct | Contents |
|------|--------|----------|
| `env.json` | `EnvSnapshot` | OS, architecture, backend identity/version, franken_whisper version (compile-time `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`) |
| `manifest.json` | `PackManifest` | trace_id, run_id, start/finish timestamps, input/output SHA-256 hashes, segment/event/evidence counts |
| `repro.lock` | `ReproLock` | Routing evidence chain, frozen replay envelope, original backend request, diarize flag |
| `tolerance_manifest.json` | `ToleranceManifest` | Schema version (`tolerance-manifest-v2`), timestamp tolerance, text/speaker exactness flags, optional validated native rollout stage, segment/event counts |

All four files are **deterministic for the same `RunReport` and runtime environment**. `env.json` deliberately records OS and architecture, so packs created on different platforms are expected to differ there; unexplained differences on the same runtime indicate pipeline or provenance drift.

### Conformance Harness

The conformance module enforces cross-engine compatibility using a single canonical timestamp tolerance: `CANONICAL_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC = 0.05` (50 ms). Segment comparison counts violations:

| Violation Type | Condition |
|----------------|-----------|
| Text mismatch | Segment text differs at the same index |
| Speaker mismatch | Speaker label differs (optional check) |
| Timestamp violation | `start` / `end` differs by > 50 ms |
| Length mismatch | Different segment counts |

Plus overlap detection (epsilon = 1 µs default), WER approximation (Levenshtein-based), and segment invariant validation: finite timestamps, non-negative values, `start ≤ end`, confidence in `[0.0, 1.0]`, non-empty text.

The conformance corpus in `tests/fixtures/conformance/` covers timestamp boundaries, speaker labels, text trimming, empty segments, overlapping speakers, unicode speaker labels, non-finite invariants, very long segments (15 min), word-level boundary cases, multilingual / code-switching / noisy-overlap audio, and replay envelope drift (`input_hash_drift`, `output_drift`, `backend_identity_drift`, `backend_version_upgrade`, …). The mapping from spec clauses to tests lives in [`tests/COVERAGE.md`](tests/COVERAGE.md).

### Speculative Streaming Architecture

Dual-model streaming for real-time transcription with quality corrections:

```
Audio Stream
  |
  +---> WindowManager (sliding windows with overlap)
  |       |
  |       +---> Fast Model ---> PartialTranscript (status: Pending)
  |       |                        |
  |       |                        v  emit transcript.partial event
  |       |
  |       +---> Quality Model ---> CorrectionDrift analysis
  |                                  |
  |                                  +- drift below tolerance ---> transcript.confirm
  |                                  +- drift above tolerance ---> transcript.retract + corrected text
  |
  +---> CorrectionTracker (adaptive thresholds)
```

The `CorrectionTracker` maintains running drift statistics and adaptively tightens or relaxes confirmation thresholds.

### Audio Normalization Pipeline

Input audio is normalized to 16 kHz mono 16-bit PCM WAV:

```
Input file (any format)
  |
  +-> Built-in Rust decoder (PRIMARY)
  |     symphonia: MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG, Vorbis, ALAC, PCM variants
  |     Resampler: linear interpolation to 16 kHz
  |     Channel mixer: stereo/surround -> mono by sample averaging (using actual frame length)
  |     Output: normalized_16k_mono.wav (PCM S16LE)
  |
  +-> ffmpeg subprocess (FALLBACK; only if built-in decoder fails)
        Triggered for: video files, exotic codecs (AC3, DTS, Opus-in-MKV, etc.)
        Args: -hide_banner -loglevel error -y -i <input> -vn -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le <output>
```

**ffmpeg fallback chain:**

1. Explicit binary path (`FRANKEN_WHISPER_FFMPEG_BIN`)
2. System-installed `ffmpeg` on `PATH`
3. Auto-provisioned local binary (Linux x86_64)
4. If all fail: `FW-CMD-MISSING` error with an actionable message

Set `FRANKEN_WHISPER_FORCE_FFMPEG_NORMALIZE=1` to bypass the built-in decoder and always use ffmpeg.

### Storage Internals

The storage layer uses `fsqlite` (from the FrankenSQLite project) with three
canonical run tables, four derived diarization index tables, and a key-value
metadata table. The schema is at version **5** at HEAD.

```sql
runs     (id PK, started_at, finished_at, backend, input_path,
          normalized_wav_path, request_json, result_json,
          warnings_json, transcript, replay_json, acceleration_json)
          -- all columns NOT NULL; replay_json + acceleration_json default to '{}'

segments (run_id, idx, start_sec, end_sec, speaker, text, confidence,
          PRIMARY KEY (run_id, idx))

events   (run_id, seq, ts_rfc3339, stage, code, message, payload_json,
          PRIMARY KEY (run_id, seq))

diarization_reports          (run_id PK, implementation, contract_version, ...)
diarization_turns            (run_id, idx, start_ms, end_ms, speaker_ref, ...)
speaker_hints                (run_id, idx, speaker_ref, start_ms, end_ms, ...)
speaker_profile_summaries    (run_id, idx, speaker_ref, reliability, ...)
          -- deterministic indexes rebuilt from runs.request_json/result_json

sync_run_mutations           (mutation_seq INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT,
                              run_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE)
          -- bounded database-owned high-water mark for incremental export

_meta    (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT NOT NULL)
          -- holds 'schema_version' => '6' and a stable sync database identity
```

**Schema Migrations.** When opening older databases, the storage layer walks forward through the migration ladder:

- **v1 → v2:** add `runs.replay_json` and `runs.acceleration_json` (defaulting to `'{}'`).
- **v2 → v3:** create indexes on hot query paths (recent-runs listing, per-run segment / event lookup) for faster `robot health` and `runs` queries.
- **v3 → v4:** add privacy-safe normalized diarization indexes and rebuild
  them from canonical typed request/result JSON.
- **v4 → v5:** add typed speaker-count status/outcome and per-hint evidence
  columns, then rebuild the derived index from canonical run JSON.
- **v5 → v6:** add a stable sync database identity plus the bounded per-run
  mutation sequence and parent/child triggers used by lossless incremental
  export; existing runs are backfilled.

The legacy column-add migration runs safely:

1. Query current journal mode (`PRAGMA journal_mode;`)
2. Switch from WAL to DELETE for DDL reliability
3. Execute `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`
4. Restore WAL mode
5. If the migration fails, log a contextual error and leave the database untouched

For severely corrupted databases the recovery path is JSONL-based: export from a known-good source, create a fresh database, import via `sync import-jsonl`.

**Atomic Persistence with Retry.** All inserts are wrapped in a single transaction with up to **8 retry attempts** on `SQLITE_BUSY`, using **linear backoff** of `5 × (attempt + 1)` ms (so 5, 10, 15, …, 40 ms across the retry budget; ~180 ms total worst case). The cancellation token is checked before each `COMMIT`.

**Cancellation-Safe Writes.** The token-checkpoint pattern ensures no partial data reaches the database:

```
SAVEPOINT fw_persist_N
  INSERT INTO runs ...
  INSERT INTO segments ... (N rows)
  INSERT INTO events ... (M rows)
  token.checkpoint()?       -- rolls back if cancelled
RELEASE SAVEPOINT fw_persist_N
```

If the token fires between inserts, the savepoint rolls back cleanly. If the process is killed during `RELEASE`, SQLite's journal recovery handles it on next open. Savepoints (not top-level transactions) let concurrent sessions nest persist calls without deadlocking.

**Concurrent Session Support.** Multiple agents can persist in parallel through `RunStore::begin_concurrent_session("agent_alpha")`, which acquires a named savepoint (`fw_session_{name}`). Session names are validated to be `[A-Za-z0-9_]` only, so no SQL injection via session names is possible.

**WAL Mode & Storage Configuration:**

| `PRAGMA` | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `journal_mode` | `WAL` | Write-Ahead Logging for concurrent readers |
| `busy_timeout` | `5000` (5 s) | Wait for locks before returning `SQLITE_BUSY` |

**Storage Diagnostics.** `StorageDiagnostics` exposes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `page_count` | Total database pages |
| `page_size` | Bytes per page (typically 4096) |
| `journal_mode` | Current mode (`wal`, `delete`) |
| `wal_checkpoint` | WAL status: busy flag, log frames, checkpointed frames |
| `freelist_count` | Unused pages available for reuse |
| `integrity_check` | `"ok"` when the database passes `PRAGMA integrity_check` |

Accessible via `robot health`, which includes database diagnostics in the health report.

### Backend Bridge Adapters

Each backend has a bridge adapter that spawns an external process and parses its output. Adapters normalize diverse output formats into a uniform `TranscriptionResult`.

**whisper.cpp Bridge.** Spawns `whisper-cli` (or `FRANKEN_WHISPER_WHISPER_CPP_BIN`) and parses the JSON output file, handling multiple layouts (`transcription`, `segments`, `chunks`) and extracting word-level timestamps from nested `words` arrays when requested.

**insanely-fast-whisper Bridge.** Spawns `insanely-fast-whisper` (or `FRANKEN_WHISPER_INSANELY_FAST_BIN`). Shares JSON segment extraction with the whisper.cpp bridge. Falls back to joining segment texts if the root `"text"` key is missing.

**whisper-diarization Bridge.** Spawns a Python script via `python3` (or `FRANKEN_WHISPER_PYTHON_BIN`). Parses two output files: a `.txt` file with the full transcript and a `.srt` file with speaker-labeled subtitles. The SRT parser handles both comma- and dot-separated timing, and recognizes speaker patterns `[SPEAKER_00]`, `SPEAKER_00:`, `spk0:`, `s0:`. Each bridge invocation logs through `render_command_for_log()`, which redacts `--hf-token` values so the HuggingFace token never appears in tracing output.

### Native Engine Rollout Governance

Native Rust replacements for the bridge adapters ship behind a 5-stage rollout with conformance gating at every promotion. This prevents a buggy native engine from silently degrading transcription quality.

**Rollout Stages:**

```
Shadow → Validated → Fallback → Primary → Sole
  |          |          |          |        |
  |          |          |          |        +-- Native only, bridge removed
  |          |          |          +-- Native preferred, bridge fallback on error
  |          |          +-- Bridge preferred, native fallback hardened
  |          +-- Bridge only, stricter conformance gating
  +-- Bridge only, native conformance validated out-of-band
```

**Conformance Gate.** At each stage transition the harness compares native vs. bridge output on a fixture corpus. A native engine that produces timestamps > 50 ms different from the bridge adapter for the same audio is blocked from promotion. The harness also validates backend version drift, replay envelope drift, and segment invariants.

**Segment Validation Rules.**

- Timestamps must be finite (no NaN, no infinity)
- `start_sec` and `end_sec` must be non-negative
- `start ≤ end`
- No overlapping segments (configurable epsilon: 1 µs default)
- Confidence scores in `[0.0, 1.0]`
- Text non-empty

**Runtime Control.** Two environment variables jointly control native engine behavior:

- `FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_ROLLOUT_STAGE`: which stage the deployment is at
- `FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_EXECUTION`: whether native dispatch is enabled at runtime (`0`/`1`)

Both default to native-only execution (`1` and `sole`). Setting the execution
flag to `0` requests bridge-only compatibility behavior; selecting an earlier
rollout stage also changes the bridge/native policy explicitly.

**Execution Path Metadata.** Every `backend.ok` event and replay envelope includes explicit execution-path metadata: `implementation` (bridge / native), `execution_mode`, `native_rollout_stage`, and `native_fallback_error` (populated when native fails and bridge recovers). The contract is documented in [`docs/native_engine_contract.md`](docs/native_engine_contract.md).

### Run Report Structure

Every transcription produces a `RunReport`, the complete record of what happened:

```
RunReport
  run_id:              "fw-run-abc123"
  trace_id:            "1710000000000-random64"
  started_at_rfc3339:  "2026-04-25T06:00:00Z"
  finished_at_rfc3339: "2026-04-25T06:00:05Z"
  input_path:          "/path/to/audio.mp3"
  normalized_wav_path: "/tmp/normalized_16k_mono.wav"
  request:             TranscribeRequest { ... }      -- full input parameters
  result:              TranscriptionResult { ... }     -- backend output
    transcript:        "Hello world..."
    segments:          [TranscriptionSegment { ... }]  -- timed chunks
    language:          Some("en")
    acceleration:      AccelerationReport { ... }      -- confidence normalization metadata
  events:              [RunEvent { ... }]              -- pipeline stage events (sequenced)
  warnings:            ["..."]                         -- non-fatal issues
  evidence:            [Value { ... }]                 -- routing decision evidence
  replay:              ReplayEnvelope { ... }          -- SHA-256 hashes for deterministic replay
```

The report is persisted to SQLite (split across `runs`, `segments`, and `events`) and optionally emitted as JSON via `--json` or as streaming NDJSON events in robot mode.

### Robot Event Streaming Architecture

In robot mode the pipeline emits events in real time via an `mpsc` channel:

```
                  +-------------------+
                  |  CLI (main.rs)    |
                  |                   |
                  |  event_rx poll    |<--+
                  |  (every 40 ms)    |   |
                  +-------------------+   |
                         |                |   mpsc channel
                         v                |
                  +-------------------+   |
                  |  stdout (NDJSON)  |   |   StreamedRunEvent { run_id, event }
                  |  one line per     |   |
                  |  event            |   |
                  +-------------------+   |
                                          |
                  +-------------------+   |
                  |  Pipeline Worker  |---+
                  |  (background      |
                  |   thread)         |
                  +-------------------+
```

The CLI thread polls the receive end of the channel every 40 ms, formatting each event as a single NDJSON line on stdout. The pipeline worker thread runs `transcribe_with_stream()` which emits `StreamedRunEvent` wrappers containing `(run_id, RunEvent)` pairs. When the worker completes, the CLI emits a final `run_complete` or `run_error` event. If the worker thread itself panics, the CLI emits a structured `run_error` envelope rather than printing a Rust panic message; the contract on stdout is preserved unconditionally.

**Schema Contract Guarantees:**

| Guarantee | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| `event` and `schema_version` present on every event | Hardcoded in all `emit_*` functions |
| `seq` strictly increasing per run | Auto-incremented from `events.len()` |
| `ts` non-decreasing per run | Generated from `Utc::now().to_rfc3339()` |
| `run_complete` is always the final success event | Emitted only after pipeline returns |
| Stage events follow pipeline order | Orchestrator executes stages sequentially |
| Worker-thread panics emit `run_error`, not a panic | `emit_robot_error_from_fw` wraps panic recovery |

### TTY Handshake Protocol

The TTY audio protocol begins with version and codec negotiation before any audio flows:

```
Encoder                                         Decoder
   |                                               |
   |-- Handshake {                                 |
   |     min_version: 1,                           |
   |     max_version: 2,                           |
   |     supported_codecs: ["mulaw+zlib+b64"]      |
   |   } -------------------------------------->   |
   |                                               |
   |   <---------------------------------------    |
   |       HandshakeAck {                          |
   |         negotiated_version: 1,                |
   |         negotiated_codec: "mulaw+zlib+b64"    |
   |       }                                       |
   |                                               |
   |-- AudioFrame { seq: 0, ... } ------------>    |
   |-- AudioFrame { seq: 1, ... } ------------>    |
   |           ...                                 |
   |-- SessionClose { last_data_seq: N } ----->    |
   |                                               |
   |   <--- Ack { up_to_seq: N }                   |
```

**Version Negotiation.** The encoder advertises a supported range (currently 1–2). The decoder picks the highest version both support. If ranges don't overlap, the handshake fails.

**Codec Negotiation.** Currently `"mulaw+zlib+b64"` is the only defined codec. The protocol is extensible; future codecs (for example `opus+b64`) can be added by extending the `supported_codecs` array.

**Session Close.** The encoder sends `SessionClose { reason, last_data_seq }` to signal end of stream. The decoder verifies it has received all frames up to `last_data_seq`. Missing frames trigger the retransmit protocol; sequence gaps detected at finalize raise an explicit error rather than truncating silently.

### Retransmit Loop Determinism

The retransmit system is designed to be **fully deterministic** for testing and debugging:

- Given the same frame buffer and the same loss pattern, the output and report are byte-identical across runs.
- No timing dependencies; `timeout_ms` is advisory (used for reporting) with no actual sleeps or waits.
- Frame recovery proceeds in sequence-number order (not arrival order).
- Strategy escalation follows a fixed chain: `Simple → Redundant → Escalate`.
- `inject_loss()` resets all prior recovery state, ensuring clean separation between test scenarios.

This determinism supports fuzz testing of the retransmit protocol without
timing-dependent expectations.

### ffmpeg Auto-Provisioning

When ffmpeg is needed but not installed, `franken_whisper` can automatically download a static binary (Linux x86_64 only):

**Source:** `https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz`

**Flow:**

1. Check `FRANKEN_WHISPER_AUTO_PROVISION_FFMPEG` (default: `1` / enabled)
2. Check if a provisioned binary already exists at `{state_root}/tools/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg`
3. If missing: download via `curl -fsSL` or `wget --quiet` (whichever is available)
4. Extract from `.tar.xz` via `tar -xf` into a tmpdir
5. Copy `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to `{state_root}/tools/ffmpeg/bin/`
6. Set executable permissions (`chmod 755`)
7. Verify the extracted binaries are executable

**Safeguards:**

- 180-second download timeout
- Atomic install: a tmpdir is used during extraction, then moved into place
- Failure is non-fatal: log a warning and continue (the built-in Rust decoder handles most audio formats anyway)
- Honors `XDG_STATE_HOME` for the install root
- Disable entirely with `FRANKEN_WHISPER_AUTO_PROVISION_FFMPEG=0`
- Non-Linux / non-x86_64 platforms get an actionable error explaining how to install ffmpeg manually

  | returns Err(Cancelled) at next checkpoint
  v
Pipeline stage catches Cancelled
  | rolls back any in-progress transaction (savepoint)
  | cleans up temp files via finalizers
  | kills active subprocesses
  v
CLI exits with code 130 (128 + SIGINT)
```

The cancellation token is threaded through every pipeline stage, including the inner extraction loops in word-level timestamp processing, so an in-flight backend can be interrupted between checkpoints rather than after the entire backend invocation completes.

### Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `FW-IO` | I/O error (file not found, permission denied) |
| `FW-JSON` | JSON serialization / deserialization failure |
| `FW-CMD-MISSING` | Required external binary not found on `PATH` |
| `FW-CMD-FAILED` | Backend subprocess exited with non-zero status |
| `FW-CMD-TIMEOUT` | Backend subprocess exceeded timeout |
| `FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE` | No suitable backend found for the request |
| `FW-INVALID-REQUEST` | Malformed or contradictory request parameters |
| `FW-CONTRACT-VIOLATION` | An in-process producer violated a runtime contract |
| `FW-STORAGE` | SQLite persistence error |
| `FW-UNSUPPORTED` | Requested feature not available |
| `FW-MISSING-ARTIFACT` | Expected output file not produced by backend |
| `FW-CANCELLED` | Operation cancelled via token or Ctrl+C |
| `FW-STAGE-TIMEOUT` | Pipeline stage exceeded its budget |

**Robot Error Contract.** Public robot `run_error` envelopes expose the same
13 variant-specific codes as `FwError::error_code()`; agents do not need to
reverse-map a coarse error family. Even Clap-level syntax failures produce one
path-safe `FW-INVALID-REQUEST` JSON object on stdout and exit with usage code
2. Semantically invalid requests emit `run_start` followed by the exact
terminal error. There is no robot path that degrades to human-readable stderr.

### Engine Trait & Backend Capabilities

Every backend (bridge or native) implements the `Engine` trait:

```rust
pub trait Engine: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;          // "whisper.cpp", "insanely-fast-whisper", etc.
    fn kind(&self) -> BackendKind;           // WhisperCpp, InsanelyFast, WhisperDiarization
    fn capabilities(&self) -> EngineCapabilities;
    fn is_available(&self) -> bool;          // PATH probe via `which` crate
    fn run(
        &self,
        request: &TranscribeRequest,
        normalized_wav: &Path,
        work_dir: &Path,
        timeout: Duration,
    ) -> FwResult<TranscriptionResult>;
}
```

**EngineCapabilities** describe what each backend supports:

| Capability | whisper.cpp | insanely-fast | whisper-diarization |
|------------|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
| `supports_diarization` | false (TinyDiarize exists separately) | true (with HF token) | true |
| `supports_translation` | true | true | false |
| `supports_word_timestamps` | true | true | false |
| `supports_gpu` | true (CUDA / Metal) | true (CUDA / MPS) | true (CUDA) |
| `supports_streaming` | false | false | false |

These capabilities feed the Bayesian router's quality proxy: a backend that doesn't support a requested feature gets a lower quality score for that request.

**Backend Availability Probing.** Availability is checked via the `which` crate; each backend can be overridden with an environment variable, in which case the override path is checked directly.

### Subprocess Execution & Cancellation

The process module provides three execution modes with increasing safety guarantees:

**`run_command`** (fire and forget with captured output):
```
Spawn child → wait → return (stdout, stderr, exit_status)
```

**`run_command_with_timeout`** (bounded execution):
```
Spawn child → poll exit every 50 ms → if timeout: kill + return TimeoutError
```

**`run_command_cancellable`** (full cooperative cancellation):
```
Spawn child
  loop:
    poll child.try_wait()
    if exited: return output
    token.checkpoint()?     -- if cancelled: kill child, return Err(Cancelled)
    sleep 50 ms
  hard_timeout safety net: kill child regardless
```

The 50 ms poll interval bounds cancellation response time. The child process receives `SIGKILL` (not `SIGTERM`), ensuring immediate termination of backends that may be doing heavy GPU inference. Stdout and stderr are drained on dedicated threads to prevent pipe deadlock when subprocesses produce large output.

**Secret Redaction.** Command lines are routed through `render_command_for_log()` before being emitted into traces. The renderer redacts known secret-bearing flag values, most notably `--hf-token` for the diarization bridge, so HuggingFace tokens never appear in tracing output, log files, or test snapshots.

### Mu-Law Audio Encoding

The TTY audio codec uses mu-law compression, a standard telephony algorithm that compresses 16-bit PCM to 8-bit with logarithmic companding. The actual transcoding is delegated to `ffmpeg` (`-f mulaw -ar 8000 -ac 1`) so the codec implementation isn't carried in the Rust source. `franken_whisper` instead handles framing, sequencing, integrity checks, base64 encoding, and zlib compression on top of the mu-law byte stream.

The codec definition itself is well-known and useful to understand for debugging wire traces:

**Encoding (linear PCM → mu-law):**

```
1. Input: 16-bit signed integer sample
2. Clamp to [-32635, 32635] (mu-law representable range)
3. Add bias: sample = |sample| + 132
4. Find segment: position of highest set bit (determines compression curve)
5. Extract mantissa: 4 bits from the segment position
6. Combine: segment (3 bits) + mantissa (4 bits) + sign (1 bit) = 8 bits
7. Invert all bits (wire format convention)
```

**Decoding (mu-law → linear PCM):**

```
1. Invert all bits
2. Extract sign, segment, mantissa
3. Reconstruct: ((mantissa << 3) + bias) << (segment + 1) - bias
4. Apply sign
```

This achieves ~2:1 compression (16-bit → 8-bit) while preserving speech intelligibility. The full pipeline:

```
Raw PCM (16-bit) → mu-law (8-bit) → zlib compress → base64 encode → NDJSON line
```

The inverse pipeline runs on decode. CRC32 and SHA-256 integrity hashes are computed on the raw (pre-compression) audio bytes, so corruption at any stage is detected.

### TTY Audio Wire Format

Each audio frame is a single NDJSON line:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "seq": 42,
  "codec": "mulaw+zlib+b64",
  "sample_rate_hz": 16000,
  "channels": 1,
  "payload_b64": "eJztwTEBAAAAwqD1T20ND...",
  "crc32": 3141592653,
  "payload_sha256": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `protocol_version` | u32 | yes | Protocol version (1 = audio, 2 = audio + transcript control) |
| `seq` | u64 | yes | Strictly increasing sequence number |
| `codec` | string | yes | Compression codec identifier |
| `sample_rate_hz` | u32 | yes | Mu-law audio sample rate (8000 — telephony standard for mu-law) |
| `channels` | u8 | yes | Channel count (always 1 for mono) |
| `payload_b64` | string | yes | Base64-encoded compressed audio data |
| `crc32` | u32 | optional | CRC32 of raw (pre-compression) audio bytes |
| `payload_sha256` | string | optional | SHA-256 hex digest of raw audio bytes |

Control frames use the same NDJSON line format but with a `"type"` field instead of `"seq"`:

```json
{"type":"handshake","min_version":1,"max_version":2,"supported_codecs":["mulaw+zlib+b64"]}
{"type":"ack","up_to_seq":42}
{"type":"backpressure","remaining_capacity":64}
{"type":"session_close","reason":"complete","last_data_seq":100}
```

### TTY Audio: Adaptive Bitrate & FEC

The `AdaptiveBitrateController` monitors link quality in real time and adjusts compression dynamically:

| Frame Loss Rate | Link Quality | Compression | Critical Frame FEC |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| < 1% | High | zlib level 1 (fast) | 1× (no duplication) |
| 1% – 10% | Moderate | zlib level 6 (default) | 2× |
| > 10% | Poor | zlib level 9 (best) | 3× |

**Critical Frame FEC.** Control frames essential for protocol correctness (handshake, session_close, ack) are emitted multiple times based on current link quality. Under 10% loss, every handshake frame is transmitted 3× to ensure at least one copy arrives. With independent frame loss at rate `p`, the probability all `k` copies are lost is `p^k`.

**Link Quality Assessment.**

```
frame_loss_rate = frames_lost / frames_sent
link_quality   = 1.0 - frame_loss_rate
```

Quality transitions trigger compression changes on subsequent frames; this gives automatic adaptation without manual tuning.

**Transcript Streaming over TTY (Protocol v2).** Beyond raw audio, the TTY protocol supports real-time transcript streaming via three control frame types:

| Frame Type | Direction | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| `TranscriptPartial` | sender → receiver | Speculative partial transcript from fast model |
| `TranscriptRetract` | sender → receiver | Retract a previous partial (quality model disagrees) |
| `TranscriptCorrect` | sender → receiver | Send corrected transcript from quality model |

These frames carry `TranscriptSegmentCompact` payloads, a wire-efficient representation with single-letter field names (`s` / `e` / `t` / `sp` / `c` for start / end / text / speaker / confidence) to minimize bandwidth.

**Telemetry Counters.** The decode path tracks:

- `frames_decoded`: successfully decoded audio frames
- `gaps`: sequence number discontinuities (with expected / actual pairs)
- `duplicates`: repeated sequence numbers (second copy discarded)
- `integrity_failures`: CRC32 / SHA-256 mismatches (frame dropped)
- `dropped_frames`: total frames discarded due to policy (integrity + duplicates)

### Confidence Normalization (Acceleration)

The acceleration stage normalizes per-segment confidence scores into a proper probability distribution. Raw backend confidences are uncalibrated and incomparable across engines, so normalization is necessary for meaningful cross-backend analysis.

**Algorithm:**

1. Extract confidence values from all segments
2. Replace missing / invalid values (NaN, infinity, zero, negative) with a text-length-based baseline: `ln(1 + char_count) + 1.0`
3. Compute pre-mass: `sum(confidences)` before normalization
4. Divide each positive finite value by the positive finite mass
5. Compute post-mass: `sum(normalized)` (should equal 1.0)
6. Record both masses in `AccelerationReport` for validation

**Mass normalization (CPU path):**

```
mass = sum(positive finite values)
safe[i] = value[i] if value[i] is positive and finite, otherwise 0
output[i] = safe[i] / mass                 -- normalize to sum = 1.0
```

Non-finite values (NaN, infinity) map to 0.0 in the output. If the sum is near zero (all values degenerate), the result falls back to a uniform distribution `1/N`. The `layer_norm_cpu` helper clamps its epsilon floor to a safe minimum to prevent division by zero on pathological inputs.

This confidence-normalization stage is deliberately CPU-only. Native Whisper
inference acceleration is separate and uses the required FrankenTorch kernels
described under Installation.

### Speculative Streaming Internals

The speculative streaming system combines dual-model execution with Bayesian window sizing, drift quantification, and deterministic fallback.

**WindowManager.** Divides the audio stream into overlapping windows. Each window gets a unique `window_id`, an SHA-256 hash of its audio content, and slots for both the fast and quality model results. Window sizes range from 1,000 ms to 30,000 ms, with the default starting at the configured `--speculative-window-ms` (default: 3,000 ms).

**CorrectionDrift Metrics.** When the quality model disagrees with the fast model, the system quantifies the disagreement using four metrics:

| Metric | Meaning | Typical Range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `wer_approx` | Levenshtein-based approximate Word Error Rate | 0.0 (identical) – 1.0 (completely different) |
| `confidence_delta` | Absolute difference in mean segment confidence | 0.0 – 1.0 |
| `segment_count_delta` | `quality_count - fast_count` | −N – +N |
| `text_edit_distance` | Levenshtein distance on concatenated transcript text | 0 – unbounded |

**CorrectionTolerance.** A partial transcript is **confirmed** when all drift metrics fall within tolerance, and **retracted** (with correction) when any metric exceeds its threshold:

| Threshold | Default Value | Meaning |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `max_wer` | 0.1 (10%) | Maximum word error rate before retraction |
| `max_confidence_delta` | 0.15 | Maximum confidence difference |
| `max_edit_distance` | 50 characters | Maximum text edit distance |

**SpeculationWindowController (Adaptive Sizing).** Uses the same alien-artifact engineering contract as the backend router:

- **State space:** observed correction rate (fraction of windows needing correction)
- **Posterior:** `Beta(α, β)` distribution over expected correction rate
- **Calibration:** sliding window of 20 prediction-outcome pairs with Brier score tracking
- **Fallback trigger:** Brier score > 0.25 with ≥ 10 observations

The controller adjusts window size based on correction patterns:

| Pattern | Action | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| High correction rate (> 25%) | Shrink window by `step_ms` | Smaller windows reduce correction latency |
| Low correction rate (< 6.25%) | Grow window by `step_ms` | Larger windows reduce overhead |
| Runaway corrections (> 75%) | Force minimum window size | Bound correction churn |
| 20 consecutive zero corrections | Shrink (counterintuitive) | May be over-tolerant; tighten to validate |
| High WER (> 12.5%) | Shrink window | Fast model consistently wrong at this scale |

**ConcurrentTwoLaneExecutor.** Runs both models in parallel lanes with independent timeout budgets. Results are collected asynchronously, and the faster result (always the fast model by design) is emitted immediately while the quality result triggers correction logic when it arrives. Thread panics in either lane are propagated as `FwError`s rather than silently hanging the pipeline, and mutex poisoning is recovered gracefully.

### Built-In Audio Decoder Internals

The built-in normalizer (`normalize_to_wav_with_builtin_decoder`) is a pure-Rust audio pipeline that produces whisper-compatible WAV without spawning any subprocess.

**Format Detection.** `symphonia::get_probe().format()` uses file extension hints and magic-byte probing to identify the container. Supported containers include MP3 (MPEG Layer III), MP4/M4A (AAC), FLAC, WAV/RIFF, OGG (Vorbis), and WavPack.

**Decoding Loop:**

```
for each packet in format_reader:
    decoded = codec_decoder.decode(packet)
    convert decoded samples to f32
    if multi-channel: average all channels -> mono (using actual frame length)
    append to sample buffer
```

Sample conversion handles `i16`, `i32`, `f32`, and `f64` source formats. Multi-channel audio is mixed to mono by averaging corresponding samples, using the actual frame length rather than the nominal channel count to handle truncated frames safely.

**Resampling.** A linear interpolation resampler converts from the source sample rate (commonly 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz) to whisper's required 16 kHz:

```
ratio = src_rate / dst_rate
for each output sample i:
    position = i * ratio
    left  = input[floor(position)]
    right = input[ceil(position)]
    output[i] = left + frac(position) * (right - left)
```

Computationally lightweight (no FFT, no filter bank) while sufficient for speech. Whisper models tolerate minor resampling artifacts well.

**WAV Output.** The final mono f32 buffer is quantized to 16-bit signed PCM via clamp-and-round, then written as a standard RIFF WAV header + raw PCM data. The output is always `normalized_16k_mono.wav` in the work directory.

**Empty-input guard.** `normalize_cpu` (and the builtin decoder) guard the empty-input edge case so silent fixtures and zero-length captures produce a deterministic error instead of an out-of-bounds panic.

### Sync Architecture

The sync module provides one-way JSONL snapshot export/import with distributed lock safety.

**Lock Protocol.** Before any export or import, a JSON lock file is created at `{state_root}/locks/sync.lock`:

```json
{"pid": 12345, "created_at_rfc3339": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z", "operation": "export"}
```

The lock is **kept alive while the owning PID is still running** and **age-gated** when the PID is unknown; stale locks are archived with a reason suffix and a new lock is acquired. PID-liveness checks handle Windows (`tasklist` errors treated as unknown rather than dead), Linux EPERM on `kill -0` (treated as alive: the process exists but isn't ours), and missing `/proc` entries. The combined effect is that long sync jobs never get killed by spurious lock-stealing and crashed jobs never leave permanent locks.

**Export Format.** Four files:

```
snapshot/
  runs.jsonl          # one JSON object per run
  segments.jsonl      # one JSON object per segment
  events.jsonl        # one JSON object per event
  manifest.json       # row counts + SHA-256 checksums (always uncompressed)
```

**Incremental Export (library API).** Full exports re-dump the entire database. For large databases, `sync::export_incremental()` exposes a cursor-based delta export at the library level (the CLI currently always does a full export). Schema v6 maintains one bounded `sync_run_mutations` row per run aggregate; database triggers assign a monotonic sequence whenever a run, segment, or event is inserted, updated, or deleted. Incremental mode stores the database identity and snapshot sequence high-water mark in `sync_cursor.json`, so backdated inserts and child-only updates are not lost and a cursor from an unrelated database fails closed even when its numeric sequence is in range. Each selected run is exported with its complete current segment and event set from one read snapshot, and the cursor advances only after the manifest is durably published. Legacy cursors without a database identity ignore their numeric sequence and safely cause a one-time full re-export. Child deletion marks its surviving parent, whose complete aggregate can be applied with `overwrite-strict`; the current snapshot format has no deleted-run tombstone, so removing a parent run is not propagated to another database.

**JSONL Compression (library API).** `sync::compress_jsonl()` / `sync::decompress_jsonl()` gzip-compress or decompress a JSONL file at the library level. The **import path transparently detects `.gz` variants** at runtime, so a snapshot whose JSONL files are gzipped out-of-band (for example via `gzip backup/*.jsonl`) is fully importable through the CLI without any flag; the import code switches to `GzDecoder` when it sees a `.gz` extension. The manifest stays uncompressed so it can be inspected without decompression.

**Sync Validation.** After import, `validate_sync()` compares the database state against the imported JSONL files, checking for row count mismatches and checksum mismatches. End-to-end integrity verification.

**Conflict Policies.**

| Policy | Behavior on duplicate `run_id` |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| `reject` | Fail the entire import |
| `skip` | Silently skip existing runs |
| `overwrite` | Replace conflicting `runs` rows, fail closed if child-row mutation is needed |
| `overwrite-strict` | Verified strict replacement including child-row updates (delete+insert) and stale child-row pruning |

**Parallel Pipeline.** Large imports run with a parallel segment / event import pipeline and per-stage progress tracking; off-by-one accounting bugs in the progress display were eliminated, so the displayed counts always match the row counts in the final commit.

### PipelineBuilder Fluent API

The pipeline is composed using a builder pattern rather than a hardcoded stage list:

```rust
// Default 10-stage pipeline
let config = PipelineBuilder::default_stages().build()?;

// Custom pipeline (skip stages you don't need)
let config = PipelineBuilder::new()
    .stage(PipelineStage::Ingest)
    .stage(PipelineStage::Normalize)
    .stage(PipelineStage::Backend)
    .stage(PipelineStage::Persist)
    .build()?;

// Remove stages from defaults
let config = PipelineBuilder::default_stages()
    .without(PipelineStage::Vad)
    .without(PipelineStage::Diarize)
    .build()?;
```

`build()` validates the pipeline: `Ingest` must come before `Normalize`, `Normalize` before `Backend`, and `Persist` (if present) must be last. `build_unchecked()` skips validation for testing.

### FinalizerRegistry & Bounded Cleanup

The `FinalizerRegistry` ensures resources are cleaned up even on cancellation or panic:

```rust
enum Finalizer {
    TempDir(PathBuf),       // Remove temporary directory
    Custom(Box<dyn Fn()>),  // User-provided cleanup function
    Process(u32),           // Kill subprocess by PID
}
```

**Execution semantics:**

- Finalizers run in **LIFO order** (last registered, first cleaned up).
- `run_all_bounded(budget_ms)` enforces a per-finalizer timeout, so a hung cleanup cannot block shutdown indefinitely.
- The default cleanup budget is 5 seconds (from the pipeline's `Cleanup` stage budget).
- Process finalizers send `SIGKILL` (immediate termination, no graceful shutdown for subprocesses).
- Temp directory finalizers use `std::fs::remove_dir_all`.
- If a finalizer panics, remaining finalizers still run (`catch_unwind`).

### Clippy & Lint Configuration

The codebase enforces strict linting beyond the crate-wide
`#![deny(unsafe_code)]` policy and its explicitly scoped native-kernel
exceptions:

```toml
[lints.clippy]
enum_glob_use = "warn"              # No wildcard enum imports
explicit_into_iter_loop = "warn"    # Use .iter() not .into_iter() on references
explicit_iter_loop = "warn"         # Prefer for x in &collection
flat_map_option = "warn"            # Use .flatten() instead of .flat_map(|x| x)
implicit_clone = "warn"             # Prefer .clone() over implicit copies
semicolon_if_nothing_returned = "warn"  # Consistent semicolons on unit functions
unused_self = "warn"                # Flag methods that don't use self
```

`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` is a release gate and promotes
these warnings to hard errors.

### Why These Design Decisions?

**Why Bayesian routing over multi-armed bandits?**
Multi-armed bandits (UCB, Thompson sampling) optimize for a single reward signal. Backend selection involves multiple conflicting objectives (latency, quality, failure risk) that vary per request (diarization changes the optimal backend). The Bayesian decision contract with an explicit loss matrix handles this naturally: each (state, action) pair has a multi-factor cost, and the posterior captures per-backend reliability independent of the cost model. Bandits would have to collapse the multi-factor cost into a single scalar reward, losing the ability to reason about tradeoffs.

**Why savepoints instead of top-level transactions?**
Top-level `BEGIN/COMMIT` transactions don't nest in SQLite. If a caller is already inside a transaction (for example, a concurrent session), a nested `BEGIN` either fails or starts an implicit savepoint depending on the driver. Explicit `SAVEPOINT` / `RELEASE` always nest correctly and make the isolation boundaries visible in the code. The naming convention (`fw_persist_N` for persistence, `fw_session_<name>` for concurrent sessions) provides debuggability when inspecting WAL state.

**Why mu-law over Opus for TTY audio?**
Opus would require either an FFI binding to `libopus` with a new unsafe boundary
or a substantial pure-Rust codec dependency. Mu-law is supported by ffmpeg,
has a fixed 2:1 conversion from 16-bit PCM to 8-bit samples, and leaves
redundancy that zlib can exploit. The conversion is delegated to ffmpeg via
`-f mulaw -ar 8000 -ac 1`, avoiding another codec implementation in this
crate. The extensible negotiation protocol can add `opus+b64` later without
breaking existing peers.

**Why not whisper-rs (Rust FFI bindings)?**
`whisper-rs` provides Rust bindings to whisper.cpp via FFI, which is necessarily
`unsafe`. `franken_whisper` can orchestrate whisper.cpp as an external process,
while its native engine is a pure-Rust implementation that avoids FFI. The
5-stage rollout policy keeps bridge replacement subject to conformance evidence.

**Why a 10-stage pipeline instead of a monolithic transcribe function?**
Stage isolation provides three benefits. First, **independent budgets**: a slow normalize stage cannot eat into the backend's time budget. Second, **observable progress**: agents see exactly which stage is running via NDJSON events. Third, **composability**: the `PipelineBuilder` can skip stages that aren't needed, avoiding unnecessary work. Stage-management overhead is negligible (~1 ms per transition) compared to actual inference time.

**Why NDJSON over WebSocket or gRPC?**
NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) has three advantages for agent consumption. First, **zero dependencies**: any language can parse it with a JSON library and `readline()`. Second, **pipe-friendly**: works with `jq`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, and standard Unix tools. Third, **TTY-safe**: it flows over SSH, serial links, and PTY connections where binary protocols cannot. The bandwidth tradeoff is irrelevant for a speech-to-text pipeline where inference (not I/O) is the bottleneck.

### Alien-Artifact Engineering Contracts

Every adaptive controller in `franken_whisper` follows a formal *alien-artifact engineering contract*, a design discipline that prevents adaptive systems from making unbounded bad decisions.

**The problem it solves.** Adaptive algorithms (Bayesian routers, auto-tuners, ML-based controllers) can behave unpredictably when their models are wrong. A Bayesian router with a bad prior will confidently make terrible decisions. An auto-tuner with noisy data will oscillate. The standard response ("just add more data" or "tune the hyperparameters") doesn't work for a CLI tool running on user machines with no ops team watching dashboards.

**The contract requires every adaptive controller to declare:**

| Component | Purpose | Example (Backend Router) |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------|
| **State space** | What does the controller observe? | 3 availability states (all / partial / none) |
| **Action space** | What can it decide? | 4 actions (try each backend + error) |
| **Loss matrix** | What's the cost of each state × action? | 3×4 matrix: latency(45%) + quality(35%) + failure(20%) |
| **Posterior terms** | How confident is the model? | Beta distribution per backend |
| **Calibration metric** | How accurate are predictions? | Brier score on 50-observation sliding window |
| **Deterministic fallback** | What happens when the model is wrong? | Static priority list |
| **Fallback trigger** | When does fallback activate? | Brier > 0.35 or calibration < 0.3 or < 5 observations |
| **Evidence ledger** | Audit trail of all decisions | Circular buffer of 200 `RoutingEvidenceLedgerEntry` records |

**What the contract buys you.** Bounded worst-case behavior. Even if the Bayesian model is perfectly miscalibrated, the system falls back to a simple priority list that always works. The evidence ledger makes every decision inspectable after the fact. The loss matrix makes the tradeoffs explicit rather than buried in code. And fallback runs continue to record adaptive predictions so the calibration data keeps accumulating; once the model is good enough again, the adaptive controller can take over without manual intervention.

**Controllers using this contract:**

- Backend router (Bayesian backend selection)
- Adaptive bitrate controller (TTY audio link quality)
- Budget tuner (pipeline stage timeout recommendations)
- Correction tracker (speculation confirmation thresholds)
- Speculative window controller (adaptive window sizing)

### Pipeline Composition & Stage Isolation

**PipelineCx (Pipeline Context).** Every pipeline run creates a `PipelineCx` that carries shared state through all stages:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `trace_id` | `TraceId` | Unique identifier from `(timestamp_ms, random_u64)` |
| `deadline` | `Option<DateTime<Utc>>` | Absolute wall-clock deadline for the entire pipeline |
| `budget` | `Budget` | Remaining time budget (decremented by stage service times) |
| `evidence` | `Vec<Value>` | JSON evidence accumulator for post-hoc analysis |
| `finalizers` | `FinalizerRegistry` | Cleanup handlers run on pipeline exit (bounded to 5 s) |

**CancellationToken (Copy + Send + Sync).** A lightweight handle extracted from `PipelineCx` for passing into background threads and subprocess monitors:

```rust
struct CancellationToken {
    deadline: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

The token's `checkpoint()` method checks two conditions: (1) has Ctrl+C been pressed (global `AtomicBool`), and (2) has the deadline passed. If either is true, it returns `Err(Cancelled)`. Stages call `checkpoint()` at safe points (between loop iterations, before `COMMIT`, after subprocess completion). The token is threaded down into stage budget loops so a long-running stage honors its budget even when the per-stage timer fires before the global deadline.

**Dynamic Stage Composition.** Not every run executes all 10 stages. The pipeline skips stages that aren't needed:

| Condition | Skipped Stages |
|-----------|----------------|
| Input is already 16 kHz mono WAV | Normalize (passthrough) |
| `--no-diarize` flag | Diarize |
| No `--vad` flag | VAD |
| Accelerate excluded through `PipelineBuilder` | Confidence normalization |
| `--no-persist` flag | Persist |
| Backend doesn't support alignment | Align |
| `--no-stem` flag set | Source Separate |
| VAD detects only silence | All post-Backend stages |

Skipped stages still emit `*.skip` events to the NDJSON stream so agents can distinguish "not needed" from "failed."

### Word-Level Timestamps

`franken_whisper` supports word-level timestamps through `WordTimestampParams` (`enabled`, `max_len`, `token_threshold`, `token_sum_threshold`) on the library API. The CLI exposes `--word-threshold` as a per-word confidence filter (drop words below the threshold); the deeper `WordTimestampParams` fields are configured programmatically via the `TranscribeRequest::word_timestamps` slot.

When word-level timestamps are enabled:

- The `whisper.cpp` backend is invoked with the appropriate word-timestamp flags (`-ml`, `-wt`, `-wtps`).
- Word arrays are extracted from each segment in the backend's JSON output.
- The extraction loop honors the pipeline's cancellation token so an in-flight word extraction can be interrupted mid-segment rather than only after the entire backend invocation completes.
- Each word receives a `confidence` score (filtered by `--word-threshold` if set) and `start`/`end` timestamps inside its parent segment.
- Native engine pilots are required to match bridge word-level output to the 50 ms canonical tolerance before they can be promoted past the `validated` rollout stage.

### Evidence Ledger & Routing History

Every routing decision records a `RoutingEvidenceLedgerEntry` in a 200-entry circular buffer:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `decision_id` | String | Unique decision identifier |
| `trace_id` | String | Links to pipeline trace |
| `timestamp_rfc3339` | String | When the decision was made |
| `observed_state` | String | Availability state at decision time |
| `chosen_action` | String | Which backend was selected |
| `policy_id` | String | Which routing policy was active |
| `loss_matrix_hash` | String | Provenance tracking for the loss matrix |
| `availability` | `Vec<(String, bool)>` | Per-backend availability snapshot |
| `duration_bucket` | String | Audio duration category (short / medium / long) |
| `diarize` | bool | Whether diarization was requested |
| `actual_outcome` | `Option<RoutingOutcomeRecord>` | Observed success / failure (filled post-run) |

Queryable via `robot routing-history` and included in stage event payloads for post-hoc analysis. The `loss_matrix_hash` field enables detecting when the routing policy itself changed between runs.

### Trace ID & Run ID Generation

Every pipeline run receives two identifiers:

**Trace ID** is a deterministic composite of wall-clock time and randomness:

```
trace_id = hex(timestamp_ms) + "-" + hex(uuid_v4_lower_80_bits)
Example: "18e4a0b1c00-a1b2c3d4e5f6"
```

The timestamp prefix enables time-range queries without parsing. The random suffix prevents collisions when multiple runs start in the same millisecond.

**Run ID** is a standard UUID v4:

```
run_id = uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string()
Example: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

The `trace_id` links all events across the pipeline (including routing evidence); the `run_id` is the persistence key in SQLite.

### Calibration Sliding Window

The router maintains a `CalibrationState` with a sliding window of prediction-outcome pairs:

```rust
struct CalibrationState {
    observations: VecDeque<CalibrationObservation>,  // bounded to 50 entries
    window_size: usize,                              // ROUTER_HISTORY_WINDOW = 50
}

struct CalibrationObservation {
    predicted_probability: f64,  // router's confidence that the backend would succeed
    actual_outcome: f64,         // 1.0 if it did succeed, 0.0 if it failed
    observed_at_rfc3339: String, // when the observation was recorded
}
```

**Update cycle:**

1. Before each run, the router predicts `p_success` for the chosen backend.
2. After the run, the actual outcome (success / failure) is recorded.
3. If the window exceeds 50 entries, the oldest observation is evicted.
4. The Brier score is recomputed from the current window.
5. Non-finite predictions (`NaN`, `±∞`) are sanitized before being stored, so pathological backend signals can never poison the calibration buffer.

**Brier Score Formula:**

```
Brier = (1/N) * Σ_i (predicted_i - actual_i)^2
```

Brier = 0.0 means perfect calibration. Brier = 0.25 is the score of a coin flip. Brier > 0.35 triggers fallback to static priority routing.

The simpler calibration score tracks `correct_predictions / total_predictions`, where a prediction is "correct" if the predicted probability matched the outcome direction (predicted > 0.5 and succeeded, or predicted < 0.5 and failed). Quick sanity check independent of the Brier score.

### Beta Distribution Posterior Updates

Each backend's reliability is modeled as `Beta(α, β)`:

- **Mean** = `α / (α + β)` (estimated success probability)
- **Variance** = `α·β / ((α + β)² · (α + β + 1))` (uncertainty)

The update rule blends the prior with empirical data:

```
if sample_count >= 5:
    empirical_weight = min(sample_count, 20)
    α += success_rate * empirical_weight
    β += (1 - success_rate) * empirical_weight
```

The weight cap at 20 prevents a long history from making the posterior too rigid. A backend that succeeded 19 / 20 recent runs gets `α += 19, β += 1`, strongly increasing its selection probability. A backend that succeeded 10 / 20 gets `α += 10, β += 10`, pulling toward neutral.

### Input Validation

Before the pipeline starts, the request is validated.

**Mutually Exclusive Input Modes.** Exactly one of `--input`, `--stdin`, or `--mic` must be specified. Zero inputs or multiple inputs produce an immediate error before pipeline construction; in robot mode, that error is a structured `run_error` envelope, never human stderr.

**Pipeline Configuration Validation.** `PipelineConfig::validate()` enforces ordering constraints:

- `Normalize` must come after `Ingest`
- `Backend` must come after `Normalize`
- No duplicate stages in the pipeline
- All stage dependencies satisfied in execution order

These checks run at pipeline build time, so invalid configurations fail fast.

**Path / Directory Guards.** Input paths are validated with `is_file` (directories rejected); empty parent components are ignored when ensuring directories exist; stdin temporary files use sanitized extensions to prevent path traversal.

**Timeout Conversion.** The `--timeout` flag (seconds) converts to an absolute deadline:

```
timeout_ms = timeout_seconds * 1000  (with saturating_mul)
deadline   = now + chrono::Duration::milliseconds(clamped_to_i64_max)
```

`saturating_mul` prevents overflow; the clamp to `i64::MAX` prevents `chrono` panics on unreasonably large timeouts.

### Stage Failure Behavior

When a pipeline stage fails, behavior depends on the error type:

| Error Type | Behavior | Event Emitted |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| `Cancelled` (Ctrl+C or deadline) | Pipeline stops immediately | `{stage}.cancelled` |
| `StageTimeout` (budget exceeded) | Pipeline stops, timeout reported | `{stage}.timeout` |
| Other errors (I/O, backend, etc.) | Pipeline stops, error propagated | `{stage}.error` |

The `stage_start` timer is cleared on checkpoint failure so elapsed time from a cancelled stage never leaks into the next stage's profile. All stage failures produce a corresponding error event in the NDJSON stream before the pipeline terminates. In-progress SQLite transactions roll back via the savepoint mechanism. Registered finalizers (temp directory cleanup, subprocess kills) run within the 5-second cleanup budget. The final `run_error` event contains the structured error code and message, so agents can programmatically determine what failed and why.

### Evidence Accumulation

The `PipelineCx` carries a `Vec<serde_json::Value>` evidence accumulator that grows throughout the pipeline:

1. **Routing decision**: the backend router pushes its decision evidence (posterior snapshot, loss matrix, chosen action).
2. **Stage observations**: individual stages record evidence about unusual conditions (e.g., normalization fallback to ffmpeg, high latency).
3. **Conformance results**: when native engines run in shadow / validated mode, comparison results are recorded as evidence.

All accumulated evidence is included in the final `RunReport.evidence` field and persisted alongside the run in SQLite. This enables post-hoc debugging without needing to reproduce exact conditions.

### TUI Internals

The interactive TUI (`--features tui`) provides a three-pane interface:

```
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+
|                   |                                     |
|   Runs List       |   Timeline / Transcript             |
|   (left pane)     |   (main pane)                       |
|                   |                                     |
|   - run-abc       |   [0.0s - 2.5s] Hello world         |
|   - run-def       |   [2.5s - 5.1s] How are you         |
|   > run-ghi       |   [5.1s - 7.3s] [SPK_01] Fine       |
|                   |                                     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+
|   Event Details (bottom pane)                           |
|   stage: backend | code: backend.ok | 4.2s              |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Keyboard Bindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus between panes |
| `Up` / `Down` | Move selection within focused pane |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Jump by page |
| `r` | Reload data from SQLite |
| `h` or `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` or `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

**Speaker Color Assignment.** Speakers are assigned distinct colors via an FNV-1a-style hash of the speaker label, mapped to an 8-color palette. The same speaker always gets the same color within a session, making multi-speaker conversations visually parseable.

**Segment Retention.** To prevent unbounded memory growth during long sessions, the TUI caps displayed segments at 10,000 (`DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENTS`). When the cap is exceeded, oldest segments are drained first, keeping the most recent transcription visible. Segments with `None` timestamps display gracefully rather than panicking; run detail load errors surface in the event-detail pane.

### Microphone Capture

`transcribe --mic` (batch capture) shells out to ffmpeg using the host's input framework; the realtime `fw robot listen` driver prefers **cpal** (CoreAudio / ALSA / WASAPI) and falls back to ffmpeg when cpal cannot open a device:

| OS | ffmpeg Format | Default Device | Notes |
|----|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Linux | `alsa` | `default` | ALSA subsystem |
| macOS | `avfoundation` | `:0` | First audio input device |
| Windows | `dshow` | `audio=default` | DirectShow |

The batch microphone flow:

1. Spawn ffmpeg with `-f <format> -i <device> -t <seconds> -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le <output>`
2. Wait for capture to complete (bounded by `--mic-seconds`)
3. Output is already 16 kHz mono WAV, so the normalization stage becomes a passthrough
4. Proceed to backend execution

Custom devices, formats, and sources can be overridden via `--mic-device`, `--mic-ffmpeg-format`, and `--mic-ffmpeg-source` flags. Active region boundaries are clamped to the actual audio duration of the captured file, preventing the pipeline from over-reading past the buffer when capture is cut short.

### Segment Comparison Algorithm

The conformance comparator aligns expected vs. observed segment lists index-by-index:

```
Input: expected[0..N], observed[0..M], tolerance

1. If N != M: set length_mismatch = true

2. For i in 0..min(N, M):
   a. Compare text:
      if tolerance.require_text_exact && expected[i].text != observed[i].text:
          text_mismatches += 1

   b. Compare speaker:
      if tolerance.require_speaker_exact && expected[i].speaker != observed[i].speaker:
          speaker_mismatches += 1

   c. Compare timestamps:
      if |expected[i].start_sec - observed[i].start_sec| > tolerance.timestamp_tolerance_sec:
          timestamp_violations += 1
      if |expected[i].end_sec - observed[i].end_sec| > tolerance.timestamp_tolerance_sec:
          timestamp_violations += 1

3. Return SegmentComparisonReport {
     length_mismatch,
     text_mismatches,
     speaker_mismatches,
     timestamp_violations,
     segments_compared: min(N, M),
   }
```

**Default Tolerance Values:**

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `timestamp_tolerance_sec` | 0.05 (50 ms) | Maximum acceptable timestamp drift |
| `require_text_exact` | true | Text must match exactly |
| `require_speaker_exact` | false | Speaker labels not required to match |

The 50 ms timestamp tolerance (`CANONICAL_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE_SEC`) is the single source of truth across the entire codebase; conformance tests, native engine rollout gates, and replay comparison all reference this constant.

### WER Approximation Algorithm

The conformance module includes a Levenshtein-based Word Error Rate calculator used in both conformance testing and speculative streaming correction:

```
1. Tokenize both transcripts by whitespace -> word sequences
2. Compute Levenshtein edit distance between word sequences
   (insertions, deletions, substitutions)
3. WER = edit_distance / max(reference_length, 1)
4. Clamp to [0.0, 1.0]
```

The conformance module normalizes by the reference (expected) length, while the speculation module normalizes by `max(fast_length, quality_length)` since neither model is the "reference."

### Overlap Detection

The `SegmentConformancePolicy` can optionally reject overlapping segments, defined as a segment whose `end_sec` exceeds the next segment's `start_sec` beyond a configurable epsilon (default: 1 µs). This catches backends that produce garbled timeline output:

```
for each pair (segment[i], segment[i+1]):
    if segment[i].end_sec > segment[i+1].start_sec + epsilon:
        report overlap violation at index i
```

Overlap detection runs before cross-engine comparison so a backend producing self-overlapping output is flagged before being compared against a reference.

### Metamorphic Testing

In addition to conventional unit and integration tests, the project ships dedicated **metamorphic test suites** that verify input → output relationships rather than oracle values:

| File | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| [`tests/metamorphic_audio_tests.rs`](tests/metamorphic_audio_tests.rs) | Audio normalization is stable under permutation of decoder paths, silence padding is idempotent, stereo→mono averaging matches manual computation |
| [`tests/metamorphic_accelerate_tests.rs`](tests/metamorphic_accelerate_tests.rs) | Softmax is permutation-equivariant and scale-invariant; layer-norm output mean ≈ 0, variance ≈ 1; attention scoring respects masking |
| [`tests/metamorphic_speculation_tests.rs`](tests/metamorphic_speculation_tests.rs) | String-distance functions are symmetric, satisfy the triangle inequality, and window-size adjustments respect bounds |
| [`src/adversarial_corpus.rs`](src/adversarial_corpus.rs) | Seventeen deterministic, public-safe diarization challenge families; bounded transform composition; exact time-shift contracts; stage-specific regression attribution; minimized content-free repro seeds |

Metamorphic tests catch entire categories of regressions where the "correct" answer is unknown but the *relationship* between inputs and outputs must hold.

### Configuration Recipes

**Fastest possible transcription (accuracy tradeoff):**

```bash
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 \
  --backend whisper-cpp \
  --model tiny.en \
  --no-persist \
  --no-timestamps \
  --beam-size 1 \
  --best-of 1 \
  --json
```

**Dependency-light native diarization:**

```bash
franken_whisper transcribe --input meeting.mp3 \
  --backend whisper-cpp \
  --model large-v3 \
  --diarize \
  --diarization-engine acoustic \
  --vad \
  --json
```

**Agent integration with health monitoring:**

```bash
# Pre-flight check
franken_whisper robot health 2>/dev/null | jq -e '.overall_status == "ok"' > /dev/null

# Transcribe with full event stream
franken_whisper robot run \
  --input audio.mp3 \
  --backend auto 2>/dev/null | while IFS= read -r line; do
    event=$(echo "$line" | jq -r '.event')
    case "$event" in
      stage)        echo "[STAGE] $(echo "$line" | jq -r '.code')" ;;
      run_complete) echo "[DONE]  $(echo "$line" | jq -r '.transcript' | head -c 100)" ;;
      run_error)    echo "[FAIL]  $(echo "$line" | jq -r '.code'): $(echo "$line" | jq -r '.message')" ;;
    esac
  done
```

**Offline archival workflow:**

```bash
# Transcribe everything into a custom DB
for f in archive/*.mp3; do
  franken_whisper transcribe --input "$f" --db archive.sqlite3 --json > /dev/null
done

# Export to portable JSONL
franken_whisper sync export-jsonl --output ./archive_snapshot --db archive.sqlite3

# Optionally gzip the snapshot for storage (the import path auto-detects .gz)
gzip ./archive_snapshot/*.jsonl

# Re-import to validate; conflict-policy=skip is a no-op on the original DB
franken_whisper sync import-jsonl --input ./archive_snapshot --conflict-policy skip --db archive.sqlite3
```

**Low-bandwidth remote transcription via TTY:**

```bash
# On remote (has audio, no GPU):
franken_whisper tty-audio encode --input recording.wav --chunk-ms 100 > /tmp/frames.ndjson

# Transfer (works over any text channel):
scp /tmp/frames.ndjson gpu-server:/tmp/

# On GPU server (has whisper, fast inference):
cat /tmp/frames.ndjson | franken_whisper tty-audio decode --output /tmp/audio.wav
franken_whisper transcribe --input /tmp/audio.wav --backend whisper-cpp --model large-v3 --json
```

### Release Binary Optimization

The release profile is aggressively optimized for deployment:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3          # Optimize runtime performance
lto = true             # Full link-time optimization across all crates
codegen-units = 1      # Single codegen unit for maximum optimization opportunity
panic = "abort"        # Abort on panic (no unwinding overhead, smaller binary)
strip = true           # Strip debug symbols from final binary
```

This prioritizes runtime performance while retaining a stripped distribution binary. The tradeoff is slower compilation (`codegen-units = 1` + LTO) and no panic unwinding (acceptable for a CLI tool where panics are fatal regardless).

## Security & Privacy

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Machine

`franken_whisper` is designed with privacy as a hard constraint:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        YOUR MACHINE                            |
|                                                                |
|  +-----------+    +-------------+    +-----------+             |
|  |   Input   |--->|  Pipeline   |--->|  Output   |             |
|  +-----------+    +-------------+    +-----------+             |
|                                                                |
|  No network calls during transcription                         |
|  No telemetry or analytics                                     |
|  No cloud sync                                                 |
|  No API keys required for native ASR, acoustic, or ECAPA     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All processing happens on your hardware using local backend binaries. The only external network access is:

- **ffmpeg auto-provisioning**: one-time download, can be disabled via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_AUTO_PROVISION_FFMPEG=0`
- **HuggingFace model downloads**: only when explicitly using an external diarization backend with pyannote models

### Secrets Redaction

The HuggingFace token used by the diarization backend never appears in log output. Every command line is rendered through `render_command_for_log()` before being emitted into traces; the renderer redacts `--hf-token` values so neither structured tracing nor stdout transcripts contain the raw token. This applies to error messages and test snapshots as well; there is no path where the token leaks into a public artifact.

### What's Stored Where

| Location | Contents | Sensitive? |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `.franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3` | Run history, transcripts, segments | Yes (contains transcription text) |
| `.franken_whisper/locks/` | Sync lock files (PID, timestamp only) | No |
| `<work_dir>/normalized_16k_mono.wav` | Temporary normalized audio | Yes (audio content; cleaned up by finalizers) |
| JSONL snapshots | Exported run history | Yes (contains transcription text) |
| `{state_root}/tools/ffmpeg/bin/*` | Auto-provisioned ffmpeg binary | No |

### Secure Deletion

```bash
# Remove all franken_whisper state
rm -rf .franken_whisper/

# Or just the database (preserves auto-provisioned ffmpeg)
rm .franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3
```

-- v4 adds derived diarization reports, turns, hint audits, and privacy-safe
-- profile summaries rebuilt from canonical runs JSON.
-- v5 adds typed speaker-count status/outcome JSON and privacy-safe per-hint
-- disposition JSON to the derived diarization report index.
-- v6 adds a bounded per-run mutation sequence and triggers for lossless
-- incremental export of run, segment, and event changes, plus a stable
-- sync database identity in _meta so cursors cannot cross database lineages.
```

### NDJSON Export Format

JSONL snapshots mirror the database schema:

**`runs.jsonl`** (one JSON object per line):
```json
{"id":"fw-run-abc","started_at":"2026-04-25T06:00:00Z","finished_at":"2026-04-25T06:00:05Z","backend":"whisper_cpp","transcript":"Hello world...","replay_json":"{...}"}
```

**`segments.jsonl`:**
```json
{"run_id":"fw-run-abc","idx":0,"start_sec":0.0,"end_sec":2.5,"text":"Hello world","confidence":0.95}
```

**`events.jsonl`:**
```json
{"run_id":"fw-run-abc","seq":0,"ts_rfc3339":"2026-04-25T06:00:00Z","stage":"ingest","code":"ingest.start","message":"materializing input","payload_json":"{}"}
```

**`manifest.json`** (integrity metadata):
```json
{
  "exported_at": "2026-04-25T06:30:00Z",
  "run_count": 42,
  "segment_count": 1847,
  "event_count": 336,
  "runs_sha256": "a1b2c3...",
  "segments_sha256": "d4e5f6...",
  "events_sha256": "g7h8i9..."
}
```

### Key Data Types

**TranscribeRequest** (the full input specification):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `input` | `InputSource` | Tagged enum: `File { path }` / `Stdin { source_hint }` / `Microphone { seconds, device, ffmpeg_format, ffmpeg_source }` |
| `backend` | `BackendKind` | `Auto`, `WhisperCpp`, `InsanelyFast`, or `WhisperDiarization` |
| `model` | `Option<String>` | Model name or path forwarded to backend |
| `language` | `Option<String>` | Language hint (ISO 639-1) |
| `translate` | `bool` | Translate to English |
| `diarize` | `bool` | Enable speaker diarization |
| `persist` | `bool` | Persist run to SQLite (inverse of `--no-persist`) |
| `db_path` | `PathBuf` | SQLite database path |
| `timeout_ms` | `Option<u64>` | Overall pipeline timeout in milliseconds |
| `backend_params` | `BackendParams` | Aggregate of all backend-specific tunables — decoding params (beam / temperature / thresholds), VAD params, diarization config, speculative config, alignment overrides, word-timestamp params, audio windowing, output format selectors |

The `BackendParams` aggregate is the catch-all for every backend-specific tuning knob. The CLI marshals every `transcribe` flag into the corresponding field here, and downstream stages read what they need (VAD reads `vad_params`, the speculative path reads `speculative`, the bridge adapters read decoding params, and so on).

**TranscriptionResult** (what the backend produces):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `transcript` | `String` | Full transcript text |
| `segments` | `Vec<TranscriptionSegment>` | Timed segments with text, speaker, confidence |
| `language` | `Option<String>` | Detected language |
| `acceleration` | `Option<AccelerationReport>` | Confidence normalization metadata |
| `raw_backend_json` | `Option<String>` | Preserved raw backend output for replay |

**RunEvent** (a single pipeline event):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `seq` | `u64` | Strictly increasing per run |
| `ts_rfc3339` | `String` | Non-decreasing RFC-3339 timestamp |
| `stage` | `String` | Pipeline stage (e.g., `"ingest"`, `"backend"`, `"speculation"`) |
| `code` | `String` | Event code (e.g., `"backend.routing.decision_contract"`) |
| `message` | `String` | Human-readable description |
| `payload` | `Value` | Event-specific JSON payload |

## Performance Characteristics

### Native Engine Speed (measured)

The competitive rows below come from live `whisper-cli` incumbent arms in
`examples/incumbent_ab.rs`: both binaries run side-by-side in the same
invocation at 32 requested threads and matched greedy decode settings
(`whisper-cli -bs 1 -bo 1`).

| Comparison (matched-greedy) | Model | Clip / mode | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| vs `whisper.cpp` (CPU) | `large-v3-turbo` | 124.5 s, whole job, no timestamps | **2.99× faster** |
| vs `whisper.cpp` (CPU) | `tiny.en` | 124.5 s, transcribe only, no timestamps | **1.52× faster** |
| vs `whisper.cpp` (CPU) | `tiny.en` | 300 s, transcribe only, no timestamps | **1.51× faster** |

**Measurement contract.**

- **Campaign wins use the actual incumbent** — a competitive result requires the legacy incumbent arm to run side-by-side with franken in the same harness invocation. A before/after comparison of franken against itself is recorded as a maintenance self-speedup, never as a competitive result.
- **Paired null (A/A) control, same binary** — every new wall-time A/B verdict must carry an identity null in the same invocation, with order-interleaved arms, so host contention and run-order bias cannot masquerade as a speedup. A counted-mechanism rejection may omit timing inference only when the unchanged count itself proves that no work was removed.
- **Byte/ULP-exact where claimed** — byte-exact levers are asserted bit-identical to the reference path; the sole numerics-affecting default (poly-exp) is held to WER-Δ 0.000 vs `whisper.cpp`.
- **Negative-evidence ledger** — new rejected levers record either a numerical same-invocation A/A null or a counted unchanged-work mechanism, plus a concrete retry predicate. The pre-commit gate rejects undecidable rows. See [`docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md) and [`docs/LEDGER_RESURRECTION.md`](docs/LEDGER_RESURRECTION.md).
- **Gate.** A result is decidable only when both same-invocation A/A null medians lie in `[0.98, 1.02]` inclusive, its comparison CI95 excludes `1.0`, and its effect clears 2× the widest null-CI edge from `1.0`. A null CI need not straddle `1.0`; its widest edge calibrates the margin. `cv` is recorded as provenance and never decides a verdict.

**Scope.** These are **greedy / temperature-0** comparisons with the reference
explicitly forced to the same decode mode (`-bs 1 -bo 1`). The turbo row is
whole-process wall time, including startup, model/audio I/O, inference,
serialization, and teardown; both arms also use `max_context=0`. The tiny.en
rows are transcribe-only and exclude one-time model load. All three use a
quiet Threadripper host at requested/configured width 32 with order-alternating
pairs and per-engine A/A controls. The full record lives in
[`docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`](docs/PERF_LEDGER.md) and
[`docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md).

### Audio Normalization

| Input Format | Duration | Normalization Time | Method |
|--------------|----------|--------------------|--------|
| MP3 (128 kbps, stereo) | 2 min | ~260 ms | Built-in (`symphonia`) |
| FLAC (16-bit, 44.1 kHz) | 2 min | ~180 ms | Built-in (`symphonia`) |
| WAV (16 kHz, mono) | 2 min | ~5 ms | Passthrough (already normalized) |
| MP4 (video, AAC audio) | 2 min | ~500 ms | ffmpeg fallback |

The built-in path is fast because it runs entirely in-process with no subprocess spawning, no temporary file juggling, and no `PATH` dependency.

### Pipeline Overhead

Typical overhead beyond the backend inference time:

| Component | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| CLI parse | < 1 ms | clap argument parsing |
| Database open | ~5 ms | SQLite connection + schema check |
| Ingest | ~1 ms | File existence check, size read |
| Normalize (MP3) | ~260 ms | Built-in Rust decoder |
| Persistence | ~10 ms | SQLite transaction (8 retry budget) |
| Latency profiling | ~1 ms | Compute utilization ratios |
| Report assembly | ~2 ms | JSON serialization |
| **Total overhead** | **~280 ms** | **Everything except actual inference** |

The backend inference stage dominates total runtime (typically 3–60 seconds depending on audio length, model size, and hardware).

### Benchmark Suites

Five Criterion benchmark suites measure performance of critical paths:

| Benchmark | What it measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| `storage_bench` | SQLite persist / query throughput, concurrent access |
| `normalize_bench` | Audio normalization latency by format and duration |
| `pipeline_bench` | End-to-end pipeline overhead (mocked backend) |
| `tty_bench` | TTY encode / decode throughput, retransmit loop latency |
| `sync_bench` | JSONL export / import throughput, compression ratios |

Run with: `cargo bench --bench <name>`

The benchmark regression policy is documented in [`docs/benchmark_regression_policy.md`](docs/benchmark_regression_policy.md).

### Binary Size

With the release profile (`opt-level = 3`, full LTO, stripped):

| Build | Approximate Size |
|-------|------------------|
| Debug | ~150 MB |
| Release (default) | ~20 MB |
| Release (optimized profile) | ~12 MB |
| Release + `--features tui` | ~15 MB |

## Testing

The repository has thousands of unit, integration, conformance, metamorphic,
and model-gated tests. The default suite deliberately ignores models found only
in implicit home-directory caches, keeping ordinary development checks bounded
and deterministic. Set an explicit `FRANKEN_WHISPER_TEST_MODEL_DIR`, or opt into
the complete local-model stress lane with `FRANKEN_WHISPER_ULTRA_STRESS=1`.

```bash
# normal development gate (no accidental multi-minute model inference)
cargo test

# opt-in ultra stress gate using models installed in the normal local caches
FRANKEN_WHISPER_ULTRA_STRESS=1 cargo test

# library tests only
cargo test --lib

# run specific test module
cargo test --lib -- backend::tests
cargo test --lib -- robot::tests
cargo test --lib -- tty_audio::tests

# run integration tests

## Release Engineering

[Doodlestein Self Releaser (DSR)](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/doodlestein_self_releaser)
is the canonical release authority. Its local registration builds Linux x86_64
and ARM64, macOS Intel and Apple Silicon, and Windows x86_64 on native/SSH
hosts; packages both `franken_whisper` and `fw`; and syncs the exact pinned
`frankensqlite`, `frankentorch`, `frankentui`, and `frankentts` commits adjacent
to the source tree.

```bash
dsr build franken_whisper --version 0.9.2 --dry-run \
  --targets darwin/arm64,darwin/amd64,linux/amd64,linux/arm64,windows/amd64
dsr build franken_whisper --version 0.9.2 \
  --targets darwin/arm64,darwin/amd64,linux/amd64,linux/arm64,windows/amd64
```

No GitHub Actions workflow participates in the v0.9.2 release. DSR is the build
and packaging authority; the tag and release assets are verified against its
local receipts before publication.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE: native Whisper package is missing`

The all-native default requires the compiled-hash-pinned release package. Run
`fw pull all` to provision both default models, or `fw pull whisper` for a
transcript-only installation. An operator-supplied GGML model remains available
as an explicit override through `--model PATH_OR_SHORT_NAME` or
`FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_DEFAULT_MODEL`; arbitrary files in legacy search
directories never silently replace the packaged default. To deliberately use
the compatibility bridge instead, install its binary and opt into a bridge
rollout:

```bash
# whisper.cpp
brew install whisper-cpp                                  # macOS
# or build from source: https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp

# or override the binary name
export FRANKEN_WHISPER_WHISPER_CPP_BIN=/path/to/whisper-cli
export FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_EXECUTION=0
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --backend whisper-cpp --no-diarize
```

### `FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE: external diarization requires HF token`

The optional pyannote backend needs a HuggingFace API token. The Rust acoustic
engine does not:

```bash
export FRANKEN_WHISPER_HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
# or pass directly
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --diarize --hf-token "hf_..."

# or stay entirely in process
franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --diarize \
  --diarization-engine acoustic
```

The token is automatically redacted from command logs.

### `FW-CMD-TIMEOUT: backend exceeded timeout`

The backend took longer than the allowed duration:

```bash
# increase the overall pipeline timeout (seconds)
franken_whisper transcribe --input long_audio.mp3 --timeout 600 --json

# or raise the per-stage backend budget
FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_BACKEND_MS=1800000 \
  franken_whisper transcribe --input long_audio.mp3 --json
```

### Robot mode outputs nothing

Ensure you're using the `robot run` subcommand, not just `robot`:

```bash
franken_whisper robot run --input audio.mp3 --backend auto
```

### SQLite `database is locked`

Another `franken_whisper` process is writing. The storage layer retries with linear backoff (5–40 ms across 8 attempts, ~180 ms total worst case), but simultaneous heavy writes may conflict. Use `--no-persist` to skip persistence, or use separate `--db` paths.

### Built-in decoder fails on a file ffmpeg handles fine

Some formats or containers are outside `symphonia`'s coverage. Force the ffmpeg path:

```bash
export FRANKEN_WHISPER_FORCE_FFMPEG_NORMALIZE=1
franken_whisper transcribe --input exotic_file.opus --json
```

### Native engine produced different output than the bridge

Check the rollout stage:

```bash
echo "${FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_ROLLOUT_STAGE:-sole}"
echo "${FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_EXECUTION:-1}"
```

Roll back to `fallback` while the conformance harness investigates:

```bash
export FRANKEN_WHISPER_NATIVE_ROLLOUT_STAGE=fallback
```

### Sync says "lock held by PID X but process gone"

The sync lock is age-gated when the owning PID is unknown. Wait the configured idle window or remove the lock file directly:

```bash
rm .franken_whisper/locks/sync.lock
```

---

## Limitations

- **Both default model packages are required for the default pipeline.** The installer provisions them, or run `fw pull all`. `--no-diarize` removes the Sortformer requirement for a transcript-only request. Explicit bridge modes remain available when their external tools are installed.
- **ffmpeg only needed for video / exotic formats / batch mic / live fallback.** The built-in Rust decoder handles common audio formats natively. Batch `transcribe --mic` uses ffmpeg; `fw robot listen` prefers cpal and falls back to ffmpeg only when cpal cannot open the device.
- **Source checkouts need pinned siblings.** The Git checkout intentionally uses versioned path dependencies for FrankenSQLite, FrankenTorch, and optional FrankenTUI development. Run `scripts/prepare_release_siblings.sh` before a source build. The crates.io package resolves the same version requirements from the registry and does not require sibling checkouts.
- **Native execution is the default, not a certification claim.** The `sole` stage prevents silent bridge fallback. Sortformer remains development-uncertified and capped at four anonymous lanes despite being the product default.
- **One-way sync.** JSONL export / import is one-way. There is no bidirectional merge beyond the explicit `--conflict-policy` flag.
- **Single-machine.** Designed for single-machine use with local SQLite. No distributed or multi-node support.
- **ffmpeg auto-provisioning is Linux x86_64 only.** On other platforms (`macOS`, Windows, Linux ARM) install ffmpeg manually for formats `symphonia` cannot decode, batch microphone capture, or live-capture fallback.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need all three backends installed?**
No. The default install needs no bridge backend: it provisions the native
Whisper and Sortformer packages and runs both stages in process. External tools
are explicit compatibility/evaluation choices. `fw pull all` repairs or
provisions the native cache if it is missing.

**Q: What audio formats are supported?**
Common audio formats (MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG, Vorbis, ALAC) are decoded
in-process by the built-in Rust decoder without an external decoder. Video
files and exotic codecs (AC3, DTS, Opus-in-MKV) fall back to ffmpeg
automatically.

**Q: Can I use this as a library?**
Yes. `franken_whisper` is both a library crate and a binary. The public API exposes all modules: `backend`, `orchestrator`, `robot`, `storage`, `tty_audio`, `conformance`, `speculation`, etc.

**Q: What's the "replay envelope"?**
Each run produces a `ReplayEnvelope` containing SHA-256 hashes of the input content, backend identity, and output payload. This allows detecting drift when re-running the same input.

**Q: What's the "replay pack"?**
A four-file deterministic bundle (`env.json`, `manifest.json`, `repro.lock`, `tolerance_manifest.json`) that captures everything needed to reproduce a run on a different machine. The same report on the same runtime is byte-identical; `env.json` intentionally differs when OS or architecture differs.

**Q: How does cancellation work?**
Ctrl+C sets a global shutdown flag. The `CancellationToken` propagates through
pipeline stages, including inner word-timestamp loops. Each stage checks the
token at bounded work boundaries. SQLite work rolls back and owned subprocess
cleanup is verified; if cleanup cannot be certified, the command returns an
error that retains the original cancellation outcome.

**Q: What's the TTY audio module for?**
It enables audio transport over constrained TTY/PTY links where binary data can't flow directly. Audio is compressed (mu-law + zlib), base64-encoded, and transmitted as NDJSON lines with sequence numbers, CRC32, and SHA-256 integrity hashes. Protocol v2 also carries transcript streaming control frames, so speculative transcription can run end-to-end over the same link.

**Q: How does the Bayesian router differ from a simple priority list?**
A priority list always tries backends in the same order. The Bayesian router learns from outcomes: if a backend starts failing, its posterior degrades and traffic shifts to alternatives. When the model is poorly calibrated (Brier > 0.35), it falls back to static priority automatically, but **continues recording calibration observations** so it can resume adaptive routing once the data improves.

**Q: What happens if I Ctrl+C during a long transcription?**
The shutdown controller propagates cancellation through the pipeline. The
active stage reaches a checkpoint, rolls back uncommitted transactions,
terminates owned subprocess trees, and runs finalizers within the cleanup
budget. A verified cancellation exits with code 130; cleanup-verification
failure is surfaced as an error.

**Q: What's speculative streaming?**
Two models run simultaneously: a fast model produces low-latency partial transcripts while a quality model runs in parallel. When the quality model finishes each window, it either confirms or corrects the fast model's output. Use `--speculative` when you need both low latency and high accuracy.

**Q: What's TinyDiarize?**
whisper.cpp's built-in speaker-turn detection via `--tiny-diarize`. It injects speaker-turn tokens during inference without requiring a separate diarization pipeline or HuggingFace token. Less accurate than full diarization but zero additional dependencies.

**Q: Why SQLite instead of Postgres / Redis / files?**
SQLite fits a single-machine CLI tool: zero configuration, no daemon, ACID transactions, concurrent reads via WAL mode. The `fsqlite` crate provides a Rust-native interface without depending on system `libsqlite3`. JSONL export / import covers portability.

**Q: Can franken_whisper transcribe video files?**
Yes. Any video file ffmpeg can decode (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WebM, …) is handled automatically. The ffmpeg fallback extracts the audio track using `-vn`.

**Q: What's the "alien-artifact engineering contract"?**
A design discipline for adaptive controllers. Every adaptive system in `franken_whisper` (the router, the bitrate controller, the budget tuner, the speculation window controller, the correction tracker, and the default-off live cadence/holdback controllers) must declare an explicit state space, action space, loss matrix, calibration metric, deterministic fallback trigger, and evidence ledger. This prevents adaptive systems from making unbounded bad decisions when their models are wrong.

**Q: Will my HuggingFace token end up in log files?**
No. Every command line is rendered through `render_command_for_log()` which redacts `--hf-token` values. The redaction applies to tracing output, error messages, and snapshot tests alike.

**Q: How is native engine quality enforced?**
The conformance harness compares native vs. bridge output on a fixture corpus at every rollout-stage promotion. A native engine that produces timestamps > 50 ms different from the bridge for the same audio is blocked from advancing past `validated`. Replay envelopes detect drift between runs, and the rollout stage is recorded in every `backend.ok` event and replay envelope for post-hoc analysis.

## Anatomy of a Transcription Run

Step by step, when you run `franken_whisper transcribe --input meeting.mp3 --json --backend auto`:

```
1. CLI PARSE
   Clap parses args -> TranscribeRequest { input: "meeting.mp3", backend: Auto, json: true, ... }

2. ENGINE CONSTRUCTION
   FrankenWhisperEngine::new() opens SQLite database, initializes tracing

3. PIPELINE COMPOSITION
   PipelineBuilder evaluates request flags:
   - No --vad flag           -> skip VAD stage
   - No --diarize flag       -> include native Sortformer diarization (default)
   - Accelerate excluded     -> skip confidence normalization
   - --no-persist NOT set    -> include Persist stage (default)
   Pipeline: [Ingest, Normalize, Backend, Diarize, Persist]

4. TRACE ID GENERATION
   TraceId::from_parts(1710000000000, random_u64) -> "1710000000000-a1b2c3d4e5f6"

5. INGEST STAGE (budget: 15s)
   emit: stage { code: "ingest.start" }
   Verify meeting.mp3 exists, get file size
   emit: stage { code: "ingest.ok", payload: { size_bytes: 1234567 } }

6. NORMALIZE STAGE (budget: 180s)
   emit: stage { code: "normalize.start" }

## What Makes This Different

### Learned backend selection

WhisperS2T, `transcribe-anything`, and WhisperLive let you *pick* a backend. `franken_whisper` *learns* which backend to use based on observed outcomes. The Bayesian router maintains Beta-distribution posteriors per backend, tracks calibration via Brier scoring, and falls back to deterministic priority when uncertain, without losing calibration data while the fallback is active.

### Cross-engine conformance validation

The conformance harness compares segment output across engines using a 50 ms canonical timestamp tolerance, text matching, speaker label matching, WER approximation, and replay envelope drift detection. The 5-stage native rollout governance prevents buggy engines from silently degrading quality.

### End-to-end dual-model speculative streaming

A fast model and a quality model run in parallel on overlapping windows; partial transcripts emit immediately and corrections issue when the quality model disagrees. The `CorrectionTracker` adaptively adjusts confirmation thresholds, and the entire speculation flow can run over a TTY link via protocol v2 transcript control frames.

### Full audit trail on every run

Every run is persisted to SQLite with the complete request, result, segments, pipeline events, evidence, and replay envelope. Full and incremental JSONL export with SHA-256 checksums and optional gzip compression.

### Audio decoded without an external process

The built-in Rust decoder handles MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG, Vorbis, and ALAC natively. No subprocess, no external binary, no `PATH` dependency. ffmpeg is only the fallback.

### Agent consumption is the primary interface

The `robot` subcommand is the *primary* interface: sequenced NDJSON events with stable schema versioning (v1.1.0), 13 exact terminal error codes, health diagnostics, routing history, speculation events, and structured error envelopes even for argument-parsing failures.

### Audited Rust safety boundaries

`franken_whisper` denies unsafe code by default. Explicitly annotated
native-engine kernels use runtime-gated SIMD or fully-overwritten preallocated
buffers and carry local safety arguments; unannotated unsafe code is rejected.
Cooperative cancellation, atomic transactions, bounded finalizers, and RAII
cleanup provide the operational safety boundary around inference.

## Worked Examples

These examples walk through the actual math and bit-level operations of the most opaque algorithms in the system, using concrete inputs. They are intentionally arithmetic-heavy: the goal is to make the *behavior* of the algorithms verifiable by hand rather than treating the implementation as a black box.

### Worked Example: A Single Bayesian Routing Decision

Suppose a user runs `franken_whisper transcribe --input meeting.mp3 --backend auto --no-diarize` on a 6-minute audio file. The user's PATH has `whisper-cli` and `insanely-fast-whisper` installed but no `python3` for `whisper-diarization`. The Brier score from recent runs is 0.18 and the calibration sliding window holds 32 observations.

**Step 1. Detect availability.** The router probes via `which`:

```
whisper_cpp        : available
insanely_fast      : available
whisper_diarization: unavailable
state              : partial_available
```

**Step 2. Establish duration bucket.** 6 minutes = 360 seconds. Bucket: `long` (≥ 60 s).

**Step 3. Compute latency cost per backend.** `latency_cost = base + sqrt(360) × multiplier_normal`:

```
whisper_cpp        : 12.0 + sqrt(360) * 1.0 ≈ 12.0 + 18.97 = 30.97
insanely_fast      :  8.0 + sqrt(360) * 1.0 ≈  8.0 + 18.97 = 26.97
whisper_diarization: 18.0 + sqrt(360) * 1.0 ≈ 18.0 + 18.97 = 36.97
```

**Step 4. Compute quality cost per backend.** `quality_cost = (1.0 - quality_score) × 100` with `diarize=false`:

```
whisper_cpp        : (1.0 - 0.84) * 100 = 16.0
insanely_fast      : (1.0 - 0.80) * 100 = 20.0
whisper_diarization: (1.0 - 0.63) * 100 = 37.0
```

**Step 5. Compute posterior success probability per backend.** Beta priors `(α, β)` updated with the current sliding window. Suppose recent empirical success rates are: `whisper_cpp` 0.93 (20 obs), `insanely_fast` 0.81 (12 obs), `whisper_diarization` no data:

```
whisper_cpp        : α' = 7 + 0.93*20 = 25.6   β' = 3 + 0.07*20 =  4.4
                     p_success ≈ (25.6 + 0.84*2 + 0.3) / (25.6 + 4.4 + 1.68 + 0.3) ≈ 0.870

insanely_fast      : α' = 6 + 0.81*12 =  15.72  β' = 4 + 0.19*12 =  6.28
                     p_success ≈ (15.72 + 0.80*2 + 0.3) / (15.72 + 6.28 + 1.6 + 0.3) ≈ 0.738

whisper_diarization: α  = 5             β  = 5    (prior only)
                     p_success = 0 (unavailable; availability penalty kicks in)
```

**Step 6. Compute failure cost per backend.**

```
whisper_cpp        : (1.0 - 0.870) * 100 = 13.0
insanely_fast      : (1.0 - 0.738) * 100 = 26.2
whisper_diarization: full availability penalty
```

**Step 7. Combine into total cost** (`0.45 × latency + 0.35 × quality + 0.20 × failure`):

```
whisper_cpp        : 0.45*30.97 + 0.35*16.0 + 0.20*13.0
                   = 13.937 + 5.600 + 2.600 = 22.14
insanely_fast      : 0.45*26.97 + 0.35*20.0 + 0.20*26.2
                   = 12.137 + 7.000 + 5.240 = 24.38
whisper_diarization: availability penalty (+1000) dominates → ≈ 1000+
```

**Step 8. Calibration check.** Brier = 0.18 (< 0.35 threshold) and observation count = 32 (≥ 5). Calibration is good, so the router stays in adaptive mode (no static fallback).

**Step 9. Choose action.** Lowest cost is `try_whisper_cpp` at 22.14. The router selects `whisper_cpp`.

**Step 10. Record evidence and prediction.** Push a `RoutingEvidenceLedgerEntry` (decision_id, trace_id, observed_state=`partial_available`, chosen_action=`try_whisper_cpp`, policy_id=`backend-selection-v1.0`, loss_matrix_hash) into the 200-entry circular buffer. Push the predicted probability (0.870) into the calibration sliding window. Emit the `backend.routing.decision_contract` event with full posterior snapshot for the agent.

**Step 11. After the run.** Once the backend finishes, record the actual outcome (1.0 = success or 0.0 = failure) against the prediction. The Brier score is recomputed. The Beta posterior for `whisper_cpp` updates: success bumps `α`, failure bumps `β`.

The same shape of calculation runs for every `--backend auto` decision. The math itself is microseconds; the audit trail is the expensive part, and it's worth it.

### Worked Example: Mu-Law Encoding a Single Sample

In practice `franken_whisper` shells out to `ffmpeg -f mulaw -ar 8000 -ac 1` for the actual transcoding. The bit-level math below is the *codec definition*, useful for debugging a captured wire trace or for understanding what ffmpeg is doing on your behalf.

Take a 16-bit signed PCM sample value `s = 12_345` (positive). Encode to mu-law:

```
1. Clamp to ±32635:
   s = min(max(12345, -32635), 32635) = 12345 ✓

2. Extract sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative):
   sign = 0

3. Add bias:
   magnitude = |12345| + 132 = 12477  (binary: 0011 0000 1011 1101)

4. Find segment = position of the highest set bit minus 7 (clamped to [0, 7]).
   Highest set bit in 12477 is bit 13.
   segment = 13 - 7 = 6.

5. Extract 4-bit mantissa = bits (segment+3 .. segment) shifted down:
   shift the magnitude right by (segment + 3) = 9 bits:
   12477 >> 9 = 24 = 0001 1000
   mantissa = 24 & 0xF = 8.

6. Combine into 8 bits: (sign << 7) | (segment << 4) | mantissa
                       = (0 << 7) | (6 << 4) | 8
                       = 0110 1000 = 0x68 = 104

7. Invert all bits (wire format convention):
   ~0x68 = 0x97 = 151

   Wire byte = 0x97
```

To decode `0x97` back to PCM:

```
1. Invert: ~0x97 = 0x68
2. sign = 0, segment = 6, mantissa = 8
3. Reconstruct magnitude:
   m_raw = ((mantissa << 3) + 132) << (segment + 1) - 132
         = ((8 << 3) + 132) << 7 - 132
         = (64 + 132) << 7 - 132
         = 196 << 7 - 132
         = 25088 - 132 = 24956
4. Apply sign: +24956
```

The reconstructed value (24956) differs from the original (12345). Mu-law is lossy: it preserves dynamic range (loud sounds remain loud, quiet sounds remain quiet) but quantizes intermediate values. The compression ratio is exactly 2:1 (16 bits → 8 bits) and the error is logarithmically distributed, so perceived quality stays high for speech. Adding zlib compression on top of the mu-law byte stream typically achieves another 30–50% reduction, since mu-law-encoded speech has substantial statistical redundancy.

### Worked Example: Brier Score Decomposition

The Brier score `B = (1/N) Σ (p_i − o_i)²` admits Murphy's three-component decomposition:

```
B = reliability − resolution + uncertainty
```

where, partitioning the N predictions into K bins by predicted probability `p_k` (with `n_k` observations per bin and observed mean outcome `ō_k` per bin):

- **reliability** = `(1/N) Σ_k n_k (p_k − ō_k)²`. How close predicted probabilities are to observed frequencies (smaller is better; perfect reliability = 0).
- **resolution** = `(1/N) Σ_k n_k (ō_k − ō)²`. How much predictions vary around the base rate `ō` (larger is better).
- **uncertainty** = `ō (1 − ō)`. Irreducible noise in the outcome (a property of the data, not the predictor).

A backend router that always predicts the base rate has perfect reliability (0) but zero resolution → Brier score = uncertainty. A perfectly calibrated and confident router has zero reliability AND large resolution → Brier score much smaller than uncertainty.

This decomposition explains why `franken_whisper` falls back at Brier > 0.35: if reliability is bad (predicted probabilities don't match observed frequencies), the router is making systematically biased predictions and the *safer* play is the static priority list. Once the calibration sliding window accumulates enough corrective observations to bring reliability back down, adaptive routing automatically resumes. The fallback path's calibration recording is what makes this recovery possible.

## Anatomy Series

### Anatomy of a Routing Decision

```
0. backend.routing.decision_contract emit (event sequence #N)
   payload includes: state, available[], duration_bucket, diarize, posteriors[], loss_matrix, chosen

1. probe_system_health()
   for each backend kind:
     - check FRANKEN_WHISPER_<KIND>_BIN override
     - else `which <default_binary>` (e.g. `which whisper-cli`)
     - record availability bool

2. derive observed_state:
   if all 3 available     → all_available
   if 1-2 available       → partial_available
   if 0 available         → none_available  (will emit FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE)

3. build action set: [try_whisper_cpp, try_insanely_fast, try_diarization, fallback_error]
   reorder per diarize flag (diarization-first when --diarize is set)

4. for each (state, action) cell of the 3×4 loss matrix:
   compute latency_cost = base + sqrt(duration_secs) * multiplier
   compute quality_cost = (1 - quality_proxy(action, request)) * 100
   compute failure_cost = (1 - p_success(action, posterior, request)) * 100
   weighted = 0.45*latency + 0.35*quality + 0.20*failure
   add availability penalty (+0 / +333 / +1000)

5. calibration check:
   read sliding window (50 entries)
   if observations < 5: use_static_priority = true
   if calibration_score < 0.3: use_static_priority = true
   if brier_score > 0.35: use_static_priority = true

6. select action:
   if use_static_priority:
       follow deterministic priority list (whisper_cpp > insanely_fast > whisper_diarization)
   else:
       argmin over cost cells

7. record:
   - push RoutingEvidenceLedgerEntry into 200-entry circular buffer
   - push (predicted_probability, observed_at) into 50-entry calibration sliding window
     (recorded even when fallback path executes, so calibration keeps learning)
   - emit `backend.routing.decision_contract` event with full posterior snapshot

8. dispatch to chosen backend (or return FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE if action = fallback_error)
```

   load WAV, verify 16 kHz mono
   transcode PCM → mu-law (2:1 compression)
   chunk into chunk_ms windows (default 200 ms = 3200 mu-law bytes)

2. emit Handshake frame:

                                                 mulaw → PCM, append to WAV buffer

6. emit SessionClose { reason=Complete, last_data_seq=N }

                                              7. receive SessionClose:
                                                 if any seq <= N missing:
                                                     emit RetransmitRequest with missing sequences
                                                 else: emit Ack { up_to_seq=N }; finalize WAV

8. on RetransmitRequest:
   look up requested sequences in send buffer
   emit RetransmitResponse with payloads
   if adaptive bitrate active and loss > 10%, escalate compression and FEC

9. retransmit_loop escalates across rounds:
   Round 1 (Simple)   : emit 1 copy per missing frame
   Round 2 (Redundant): emit 2 copies
   Round 3 (Escalate) : emit 4 copies
```

If link quality is poor (frame_loss_rate > 10%) the encoder pre-emptively duplicates *critical* control frames (Handshake, SessionClose, Ack) 3× so they survive independent loss probabilistically. The decoder dedupes by sequence number, so duplication never produces duplicate output.

### Anatomy of a Conformance Check

```
1. load expected segments (golden fixture from tests/fixtures/conformance/...)
2. load observed segments (from bridge or native engine output)

3. validate segment invariants on each side:
   for each segment:
     assert start_sec, end_sec are finite (not NaN, not ±∞)
     assert start_sec >= 0
     assert end_sec >= start_sec
     assert confidence ∈ [0.0, 1.0]
     assert text is non-empty
   for each adjacent pair:
     assert segments[i].end_sec <= segments[i+1].start_sec + overlap_epsilon (1 µs default)

4. compare lengths:
   N = expected.len(), M = observed.len()
   if N != M: length_mismatch = true

5. for i in 0..min(N, M):
   if require_text_exact and text differs: text_mismatches++
   if require_speaker_exact and speaker differs: speaker_mismatches++
   if |expected[i].start - observed[i].start| > 0.05: timestamp_violations++
   if |expected[i].end   - observed[i].end|   > 0.05: timestamp_violations++

6. compute WER via Levenshtein on word sequences:
   tokenize both transcripts by whitespace
   edit_distance = levenshtein(expected_words, observed_words)
   wer = edit_distance / max(reference_length, 1) clamped to [0, 1]

7. return SegmentComparisonReport {
     length_mismatch, text_mismatches, speaker_mismatches,
     timestamp_violations, segments_compared, wer_approx
   }

8. at rollout-stage promotion:
   conformance gate requires:
     timestamp_violations == 0 (50 ms tolerance)
     all segment invariants pass
     replay envelope matches (input_hash + backend_version → output_hash)
   if any check fails, promotion is blocked
```

### Anatomy of a Speculative Window

```
1. WindowManager.next_window():
   advance sliding window by (window_ms - overlap_ms)
   compute sha256 of window audio content
   allocate window_id

2. ConcurrentTwoLaneExecutor.spawn_lanes():
   fast_lane:     spawn fast_model on window with timeout budget
   quality_lane:  spawn quality_model on window with timeout budget

3. fast_lane returns first (by design):
   build PartialTranscript { window_id, model_id=fast, segments, status=Pending }
   emit transcript.partial event with monotonically increasing seq

4. quality_lane returns:
   compute CorrectionDrift:
     wer_approx           = levenshtein(fast_words, quality_words) / max(...)
     confidence_delta     = |mean(fast_conf) - mean(quality_conf)|
     segment_count_delta  = quality.len() - fast.len()
     text_edit_distance   = levenshtein(fast_text, quality_text)

5. CorrectionTracker.evaluate(drift):
   if all metrics within CorrectionTolerance:
       emit transcript.confirm {
           seq, window_id, quality_model_id, drift, latency_ms, ts
       }
       status = Confirmed
   else:
       emit transcript.retract {
           retracted_seq, window_id, reason, quality_model_id, ts
       }
       emit transcript.correct {
           correction_id, replaces_seq, window_id,
           segments (from quality model), drift, latency_ms, ts
       }
       status = Retracted

6. SpeculationWindowController.update():
   record outcome (correction or not) into observation buffer (size 20)
   compute Brier score on corrections vs. predicted corrections
   if brier > 0.25 and observations >= 10:
       use deterministic fallback (fixed window_ms)
   else:
       adjust window_ms by ±step_ms based on correction rate pattern

7. periodic emit speculation.stats {
       windows_processed, corrections_emitted, confirmations_emitted,
       correction_rate, mean_fast_latency_ms, mean_quality_latency_ms,
       current_window_size_ms, mean_drift_wer, ts
   }
```

The whole flow is end-to-end safe to ship over TTY: every event has a wire-efficient `TranscriptSegmentCompact` representation (`s` / `e` / `t` / `sp` / `c` single-letter fields), and the controller's adaptive behavior is bounded by its alien-artifact contract.

## Operational Topics

### State Directory Layout

The state directory (default `.franken_whisper/`, override via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STATE_DIR`) holds everything `franken_whisper` writes to disk:

```
.franken_whisper/
├── storage.sqlite3              # primary SQLite database (WAL mode)
├── storage.sqlite3-wal          # SQLite write-ahead log
├── storage.sqlite3-shm          # SQLite shared memory file (transient)
├── locks/
│   └── sync.lock                # JSON lock file for sync export/import
│                                # { "pid", "created_at_rfc3339", "operation" }
├── tools/
│   └── ffmpeg/
│       └── bin/
│           ├── ffmpeg           # auto-provisioned static binary (Linux x86_64)
│           └── ffprobe          # auto-provisioned static binary
├── work/
│   └── fw-run-{uuid}/           # per-run work directory (LIFO finalizers clean up)
│       ├── normalized_16k_mono.wav
│       ├── backend_output.json  # raw backend output preserved for replay
│       └── ...                  # any subprocess scratch files
└── snapshots/                   # (when sync export-jsonl --output is relative)
    └── {timestamp}/
        ├── runs.jsonl(.gz)
        ├── segments.jsonl(.gz)
        ├── events.jsonl(.gz)
        └── manifest.json
```

The state directory respects `XDG_STATE_HOME`: when set, `tools/` is rooted at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/franken_whisper/` so multiple project trees can share auto-provisioned ffmpeg without duplicating downloads.

### CLI Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Triggered by |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | Success | Pipeline completed and (if requested) JSON/NDJSON emitted |
| 1 | General error | Any `FwError` propagated to `main()` (`FW-IO`, `FW-CMD-*`, `FW-STORAGE`, `FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE`, `FW-INVALID-REQUEST`, etc.) |
| 2 | Argument parse failure | `clap`'s default exit code on invalid command-line syntax (occurs before the binary's own error handling runs) |
| 130 | Cancelled | Ctrl+C (POSIX convention: 128 + SIGINT=2) |

Process exits are deliberately coarse and published by `fw capabilities --json`: 0 for success, 1 for a parsed request that failed at runtime, 2 for invalid command syntax or values, and 130 for interruption. In robot mode, agents should inspect the final JSON/NDJSON event and its exact `FW-*` code; the process status classifies lifecycle, not root cause.

### Logging

`franken_whisper` uses `tracing` for structured diagnostics. Set `RUST_LOG` to control verbosity.

**Text format (default):**

```bash
RUST_LOG=info franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --json
# 2026-05-17T12:34:56Z  INFO franken_whisper::orchestrator: stage=normalize started budget_ms=180000
# 2026-05-17T12:34:56Z  INFO franken_whisper::audio: builtin decoder selected format=mp3
# 2026-05-17T12:35:00Z  INFO franken_whisper::orchestrator: stage=normalize ok service_ms=257
```

**JSON format (for log aggregation):**

```bash
RUST_LOG=info RUST_LOG_FORMAT=json franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --json
# {"timestamp":"2026-05-17T12:34:56.123Z","level":"INFO","target":"franken_whisper::orchestrator","fields":{"stage":"normalize","status":"started","budget_ms":180000}}
```

**Filtering recipes:**

```bash
# Backend routing only
RUST_LOG=franken_whisper::backend=debug franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --json

# TTY audio decode telemetry
RUST_LOG=franken_whisper::tty_audio=trace franken_whisper tty-audio decode --output a.wav < frames.ndjson

# Sync internals
RUST_LOG=franken_whisper::sync=debug franken_whisper sync export-jsonl --output ./snapshot

# Everything verbose except hyper / clap noise
RUST_LOG=franken_whisper=debug,clap=warn franken_whisper transcribe --input audio.mp3 --json
```

Secret values (HuggingFace tokens, in particular) never enter the log stream; `render_command_for_log()` redacts them before any subprocess invocation is recorded.

### Concurrent Agents Pattern

Multiple agents can persist into a single SQLite database safely:

```rust
// Agent A's session
let store = RunStore::open(&db_path)?;
let session = store.begin_concurrent_session("agent_alpha")?;
session.persist_report(&report_a)?;
session.commit()?;  // RELEASE SAVEPOINT fw_session_agent_alpha

// Agent B can run concurrently against the same database:
let store_b = RunStore::open(&db_path)?;
let session_b = store_b.begin_concurrent_session("agent_beta")?;
session_b.persist_report(&report_b)?;
session_b.commit()?;
```

**Concurrency guarantees:**

- WAL mode allows multiple readers and one writer at any instant.
- `busy_timeout=5000` lets writers wait up to 5 seconds on lock contention.
- Each `begin_concurrent_session` opens a named savepoint (`fw_session_<name>`); session names are validated to `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` so they cannot escape into SQL.
- Persist transactions retry on `SQLITE_BUSY` with linear backoff (`5 × (attempt + 1)` ms, up to 8 attempts).
- The cancellation token is checked before every `COMMIT` and `RELEASE`, so Ctrl+C never leaves the database in an inconsistent state.

**Coordination via MCP Agent Mail.** When the agents are coordinating work (not just sharing a database), the same project conventions used in this repository apply: each agent registers via `register_agent`, reserves file paths via `file_reservation_paths` with the issue ID in `reason`, and communicates via threaded messages keyed by `br-NNN` issue IDs. The database concurrency primitives above are necessary but not sufficient; the agent-coordination layer prevents two agents from *trying* to do the same work in the first place.

### Database Maintenance

The SQLite database accumulates rows over time. For long-lived deployments:

```sql
-- Inspect WAL growth and freelist
.open .franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3
PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);   -- force a full WAL checkpoint
PRAGMA freelist_count;             -- how many unused pages
PRAGMA page_count;                 -- total pages
PRAGMA integrity_check;            -- verify database integrity

-- Reclaim space after large deletes (run when no writers are active)
VACUUM;
```

`robot health` reports all of these in its `database` field. A reasonable monitoring rule: alert when `wal_checkpoint.log_frames` stays above a threshold across consecutive probes, which indicates a long-lived read transaction is preventing checkpointing.

**Backup procedure (recommended):**

```bash
# 1. Export the database state to portable JSONL
franken_whisper sync export-jsonl --output backup/$(date +%F)/

# 2. Gzip out-of-band (import reads .jsonl.gz transparently)
gzip backup/$(date +%F)/*.jsonl

# 3. Verify the export integrity against the live database
franken_whisper sync import-jsonl --input backup/$(date +%F)/ \
  --conflict-policy skip

# 4. Copy the snapshot off-host
rsync -a backup/$(date +%F)/ user@host:/srv/franken_whisper/backups/
```

JSONL snapshots are the canonical recovery artifact. They are portable across machines and SQLite versions, deduplicate cleanly across incremental exports, and carry SHA-256 checksums in `manifest.json` for end-to-end integrity verification.

### Recovery from Corruption

If `PRAGMA integrity_check` reports corruption or the database refuses to open:

1. **Don't run `VACUUM` on a corrupted database**; it can make things worse.
2. **Try to dump what's salvageable** by exporting recent runs from a different process:
   ```bash
   franken_whisper sync export-jsonl --output recovery/ --db <corrupted>.sqlite3
   ```
3. **Move the corrupted database aside**:
   ```bash
   mv .franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3{,.corrupted-$(date +%F)}
   ```
4. **Rebuild from the last good JSONL snapshot**:
   ```bash
   franken_whisper sync import-jsonl --input backup/latest/ --conflict-policy reject
   ```
5. **Verify** with `franken_whisper robot health` → `database.issues == []`.

The export → reimport round-trip is deterministic: replay envelopes survive intact, evidence ledgers are preserved, and every persisted run remains addressable by its `run_id` after recovery.

### Choosing a Backend (Decision Guide)

The `auto` router will normally pick the right backend, but explicit selection is sometimes useful. Quick decision tree:

```
Do you need speaker diarization?
├─ YES, waveform-derived and dependency-light  → --diarization-engine acoustic
├─ YES, ECAPA identity only and model installed → --diarization-engine ecapa
├─ YES, authorize ECAPA plus usable channel evidence → --diarization-engine ecapa-fused
├─ YES, with an installed pyannote backend     → --diarization-engine external
├─ YES, turn hints only                        → whisper_cpp + --tiny-diarize
└─ NO ──┐
        Do you have a CUDA / MPS GPU?
        ├─ YES, batching long audio aggressively  → insanely_fast
        ├─ YES, low-latency single-stream         → whisper_cpp (--no-gpu false)
        └─ NO  → whisper_cpp (CPU + Metal/CUDA fallback inside whisper.cpp)
```

For mixed workloads, leave `--backend auto` and let the Bayesian router learn from outcomes. The static priority list (the fallback when calibration is poor) already encodes a reasonable default.

### Audio Quality Considerations

Whisper models require 16 kHz mono audio. `franken_whisper`'s normalization stage performs three operations whose tradeoffs matter:

| Operation | Method | Quality cost |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Channel mixing | sample-by-sample average across channels (using actual frame length) | minimal for centered voice; spatial cues lost |
| Sample rate conversion | linear interpolation | introduces ~−40 dB aliasing above 8 kHz |
| Bit depth conversion | clamp-and-round 16-bit signed PCM | imperceptible for speech |

The linear resampler is intentional. A higher-quality polyphase resampler
would add an FFT or filter-bank implementation and more compute to the ingest
path. Whisper models tolerate this tradeoff for speech. For archival work,
pre-resample with `ffmpeg -ar 16000 -ac 1 -filter:a
"aresample=resampler=soxr"` and pass the WAV via `--input`; normalization will
recognize an existing 16 kHz mono stream.

### systemd Integration

```ini

For batch jobs, prefer a `Type=oneshot` unit and a `*.timer` for scheduling. Robot mode's NDJSON output lands cleanly in `journalctl`; pipe it through `jq` to extract specific events.

### Cross-Compilation

| Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | DSR release target | Auto-provisioned ffmpeg works |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | DSR release target | Install ffmpeg via package manager |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | DSR release target | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | DSR release target | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | DSR release target | Install ffmpeg manually; `dshow` for mic; public-corpus artifact writers fail closed |
| `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf` | Best-effort | No auto-provisioned ffmpeg; cross-build via `cross` |
| WebAssembly | Not supported | Symphonia + clap pull in OS APIs |

Cross-builds typically use [`cross`](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross):

```bash
cargo install cross
cross build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### iOS (fw-ios C ABI + SwiftUI)

Shipped since v0.9.3: the native engine runs on-device through **`fw-ios`**, a
static library exposing a C ABI (`fw-ios/include/fw_ios.h`, 18 exported
functions: engine open/close/info, Sortformer + denoiser loading, staged
audio/PCM, full run, host-pushed AlignAtt live decode, progress +
live-transcript callbacks, cooperative cancellation, string release). The
staticlib mounts this repo's own
`src/native_engine/` sources by path — one inference implementation, no FFI
into third parties, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` discipline carried to the
audited pointer island in `fw-ios/src/lib.rs`.

A SwiftUI application under `ios/Sources/` (xcodegen project in
`ios/project.yml`) wraps the handle in an actor and provides on-device
transcription, speaker naming, and JSON/Markdown export. It can also import a
playable video from Photos, Files, or the Share sheet, transcribe its locally
extracted audio, and burn a customizable word-level karaoke treatment back
into a shareable video using the decoder's real DTW alignment. Video, audio,
transcript, and rendered export remain on the device. Its bundled keyboard
uses a separate resident multilingual-tiny handle for low-latency text-only
dictation while the ordinary app path remains on large-v3-turbo. Because iOS
does not expose the microphone to custom keyboard extensions, one explicit
foreground activation starts a visible, time-bounded one-hour audio session;
subsequent keyboard Start/Finish commands remain in the current app through a
local App Group handoff, and standby samples are discarded. The session now
lasts up to one hour; the keyboard's compact animation displays real level and
frequency-band energy derived on-device rather than decorative motion.

- Contract details (return codes 0–6, ownership, threading, staging→run flow):
  [`docs/fw_ios_contract.md`](docs/fw_ios_contract.md)
- Header ↔ ABI lockstep is enforced by
  `tests/fw_ios_header_parity.rs`; a symbol added on one side without the
  other fails the suite.
- The iOS surface is a separate build product — it is not part of the CLI
  binaries or the Homebrew/curl installs above. Agents can discover it via
  the `ios_surface` key of `fw capabilities --json`.

### Build Reproducibility

The release profile fixes optimization, LTO, codegen-unit, panic, and stripping
settings; `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the compiler and `Cargo.lock` pins resolved
dependencies. DSR records the source revision and artifact hashes. This is a
controlled build contract, not a claim of byte-for-byte reproducibility across
hosts.

### Why Rust 2024 / Why Nightly

- **Rust 2024 edition** keeps the crate on the current language edition and
  its updated lifetime, pattern, and unsafe-operation rules.
- **Nightly toolchain** is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` so local and DSR
  release builds use the same compiler.
- **`#![deny(unsafe_code)]`** rejects unannotated unsafe code. Explicit
  native-engine exceptions carry local safety arguments; dependency safety
  policies remain the responsibility of their respective crates.

---

## Threat Model

`franken_whisper` is a CLI tool that runs on the user's own machine. Its threat model reflects that scope.

### What it defends against

- **Accidental secret leakage in logs.** `render_command_for_log()` redacts `--hf-token` values before any subprocess command is recorded in tracing output, error messages, snapshots, or test fixtures. The HuggingFace token never appears in any artifact `franken_whisper` writes.
- **Path-traversal via stdin input.** When reading from stdin, the temporary file's extension is sanitized so a hostile content stream cannot smuggle a `../../../etc/passwd`-style filename into ffmpeg.
- **SQL injection via session names.** Concurrent session names are validated to `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` before being interpolated into `SAVEPOINT fw_session_<name>` / `RELEASE SAVEPOINT fw_session_<name>` statements. Table identifiers in sync imports are explicitly quoted.
- **Subprocess pipe deadlock.** Subprocess stdout and stderr are drained on dedicated reader threads so a backend producing megabytes of output cannot wedge the orchestrator.
- **Partial database writes on crash / cancellation.** All persistence uses savepoints; the cancellation token is checked before `COMMIT` / `RELEASE`. SQLite's journal recovery handles the death-during-COMMIT case.
- **Race conditions on the sync lock.** The lock file is kept alive while the owning PID runs and age-gated when the PID is unknown. EPERM on `kill -0` is treated as alive (the process exists but isn't ours). Windows `tasklist` errors are treated as unknown.
- **Replay-envelope drift going undetected.** The conformance harness compares replay envelopes (input hash + backend identity + backend version → output hash) at every run. The 5-stage native engine rollout blocks promotion of any native engine whose timestamps drift more than 50 ms from the bridge for the same audio.

### What it does *not* defend against

- **A hostile backend binary.** If `whisper-cli` or `insanely-fast-whisper` is itself malicious, `franken_whisper` cannot detect that. Use distribution-trusted binaries.
- **A hostile audio file** (e.g., crafted to exploit a decoder vulnerability). `symphonia` is a pure-Rust decoder with strong safety guarantees; the ffmpeg fallback path is constrained by `-vn -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le` so options injection is hard, but a zero-day in the decoder itself is out of scope.
- **An explicitly configured hostile model file.** Installer-provisioned Whisper and Sortformer packages are checked against compiled size/SHA-256 roots. An operator can still override the Whisper model with an arbitrary compatible local path; that override crosses a separate trust boundary.
- **Side-channel leaks from inference timing.** Latency profiling produces visible timing data; an attacker who can observe `orchestration.latency_profile` events could in theory infer audio properties. In the intended single-user threat model this is not a concern.
- **Network adversaries.** `franken_whisper` does no network I/O during transcription. Network access is confined to provisioning paths: installer-invoked or explicit `fw pull all`, the optional ffmpeg auto-provisioner (Linux x86_64), and model fetching by an explicit external diarization backend. Preseed the verified cache and use `--no-pull` for air-gapped installation.

### Trust boundaries

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  USER PROCESS (franken_whisper)                              |
|  - parses CLI                                                |
|  - reads/writes SQLite                                       |
|  - emits NDJSON on stdout                                    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
                        |
        (subprocess boundary; SIGKILL on cancellation)
                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|  BACKEND SUBPROCESS (whisper-cli / insanely-fast-whisper /   |
|                      python3+pyannote / ffmpeg)              |
|  - own user, own memory                                      |
|  - own stdin/stdout/stderr pipes (drained on dedicated       |
|    reader threads)                                           |
|  - timeout-bounded                                           |
|  - cleaned up by finalizers on cancel/panic                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The orchestrator treats backend output as untrusted JSON: it must parse correctly, segments must satisfy invariants, and replay envelopes must validate. Any failure is a structured `FW-*` error, not a panic.

| **Forensic transcription with audit trail** | `--json --output-srt --output-vtt` plus a snapshot of the replay pack for chain-of-custody |
| **Karaoke / lyrics alignment** | `transcribe --input song.mp3 --output-lrc --json` then post-process with the word-level timestamps via library API |
| **Real-time accessibility captioning** | `fw robot listen` with committed `transcript.delta` text driving captions and the async quality lane's `transcript.confirm` / `transcript.correct` refining them after each utterance closes |
| **Air-gapped sensitive recordings** | Preseed and verify both release packages, install with `--offline`, and add `--no-persist` if local transcript storage is forbidden |

The common theme: `franken_whisper` is the same binary in every use case. The configuration changes; the integration story (NDJSON events, structured errors, deterministic replay) does not.

## JSON Schema Reference

Run `franken_whisper robot schema` to dump the full machine-readable schema for every robot event. The required fields per event (as enforced by `robot_contract_tests.rs` against the `*_REQUIRED_FIELDS` constants in `src/robot.rs`) are:

```text
run_start         : event, schema_version, request
run_error         : event, schema_version, code, message
stage             : event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, stage, code, message, payload
run_complete      : event, schema_version, run_id, trace_id, started_at, finished_at,
                    backend, language, transcript, segments, acceleration, diarization,
                    warnings, evidence
backends.discovery: event, schema_version, backends
routing_decision  : event, schema_version, run_id, ts, code
transcript.partial: event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, text, start_sec, end_sec,
                    confidence, speaker
transcript.confirm: event, schema_version, run_id, seq, window_id, quality_model_id,
                    drift, latency_ms, ts
transcript.retract: event, schema_version, run_id, retracted_seq, window_id, reason,
                    quality_model_id, ts
transcript.correct: event, schema_version, run_id, correction_id, replaces_seq, window_id,
                    segments, drift, latency_ms, ts
health.report     : event, schema_version, ts, backends, ffmpeg, database, resources,
                    overall_status
transcript.speculation_stats: event, schema_version, run_id, windows_processed,
                    corrections_emitted, confirmations_emitted, correction_rate,
                    mean_fast_latency_ms, mean_quality_latency_ms,
                    current_window_size_ms, mean_drift_wer, ts
listen.session_start: event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, source, capture_backend,
                    device, sample_rate_hz, fast_model, quality_model, policy, step_ms,
                    partials, vad
speech_started    : event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, utterance_id, t_session_sec
transcript.delta  : event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, utterance_id, text, t0_sec,
                    t1_sec, tokens, confidence, stability
utterance_end     : event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, utterance_id, reason, t0_sec,
                    t1_sec, text, text_truncated, delta_count
listen.warning    : event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, reason, detail
listen.session_stats: event, schema_version, run_id, seq, ts, final, audio_sec, wall_sec,
                    deltas, utterances, capture_overruns, mean_step_latency_ms,
                    p95_step_latency_ms, ttft_ms, policy_holdbacks
```

Agents can `assert` these fields on every parsed event and abort early on contract violations rather than partially handling malformed input.

Live-mode note: in live sessions the shared `transcript.confirm` / `transcript.correct` events are keyed by `utterance_id` instead of `window_id` and follow their `utterance_end`; `transcript.delta` is the append-only committed-text stream (mutable previews ride `transcript.partial`, which carries the same required fields as the batch variant).

---

## Embedding in Other Languages

Although `franken_whisper` is written in Rust, the robot interface makes it polyglot-friendly.

**Python:**

```python
import json, subprocess

proc = subprocess.Popen(
    ["franken_whisper", "robot", "run", "--input", "audio.mp3", "--backend", "auto"],
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
)
for line in proc.stdout:
    event = json.loads(line)
    if event["event"] == "run_complete":
        print(event["transcript"])
        break
```

**Node.js:**

```javascript
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";
import readline from "node:readline";

const proc = spawn("franken_whisper", ["robot", "run", "--input", "audio.mp3", "--backend", "auto"]);
const rl = readline.createInterface({ input: proc.stdout });
for await (const line of rl) {
  const event = JSON.parse(line);
  if (event.event === "run_complete") {
    console.log(event.transcript);
    break;
  }
}
```

**Go:**

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"; "encoding/json"; "fmt"; "os/exec"
)

func main() {
    cmd := exec.Command("franken_whisper", "robot", "run", "--input", "audio.mp3", "--backend", "auto")
    out, _ := cmd.StdoutPipe()
    cmd.Start()
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(out)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        var event map[string]any
        json.Unmarshal(scanner.Bytes(), &event)
        if event["event"] == "run_complete" {
            fmt.Println(event["transcript"])
            return
        }
    }
}
```

Each integration is essentially "spawn the binary, parse one JSON line at a time, dispatch on `event`." There is no FFI, no shared library, no per-language SDK to maintain. The contract is the NDJSON schema, and the schema is versioned.

## Output Format Reference

`franken_whisper transcribe` can emit several text formats in parallel by combining flags. The same `RunReport` drives every formatter, so a single transcription can produce a `.txt`, a `.vtt`, an `.srt`, a `.csv`, an extended `.json`, and an `.lrc` together. Sample shapes:

**`--output-txt`** is a plain text dump (whisper.cpp side-output style):

```
[00:00.000 --> 00:02.500]  Hello, this is a test recording.
[00:02.500 --> 00:05.100]  The system is working as expected.
[00:05.100 --> 00:07.300]  [SPEAKER_01] All clear on my end.
```

**`--output-vtt`** is WebVTT subtitles (HTML5-native):

```
WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hello, this is a test recording.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.100
The system is working as expected.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.300
<v SPEAKER_01>All clear on my end.</v>
```

**`--output-srt`** is SRT subtitles (de-facto industry standard):

```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Hello, this is a test recording.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,100
The system is working as expected.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,300
[SPEAKER_01] All clear on my end.
```

**`--output-csv`** is a segment-per-row tabular form for spreadsheet ingestion:

```csv
idx,start_sec,end_sec,speaker,text,confidence
0,0.000,2.500,,Hello, this is a test recording.,0.93
1,2.500,5.100,,The system is working as expected.,0.91
2,5.100,7.300,SPEAKER_01,All clear on my end.,0.88
```

**`--output-json-full`** is extended JSON with full segment + acceleration + replay metadata (a superset of `--json`'s default summary form).

**`--output-lrc`** is LRC karaoke format keyed to milliseconds:

```
[ti:test recording]
[00:00.00]Hello, this is a test recording.
[00:02.50]The system is working as expected.
[00:05.10][SPEAKER_01] All clear on my end.
```

**Combining outputs.** Output flags are additive; supply as many as you want. Each writes to a sibling file next to `--transcript-path` (or a default derived from the input filename). The flags don't suppress JSON on stdout: `--json --output-srt --output-vtt` writes the full JSON report to stdout *and* drops two subtitle files on disk.

---

## Health Report Field Reference

`franken_whisper robot health` emits a `health.report` event with this structure (real example, fields annotated):

```jsonc
{
  "event": "health.report",
  "schema_version": "1.1.0",
  "ts": "2026-05-17T12:34:56Z",
  "backends": [                       // one entry per known backend
    {
      "name": "whisper.cpp",          // human-readable backend name
      "available": true,              // PATH probe + override env var honored
      "path": "/usr/local/bin/whisper-cli",  // resolved binary path (null if missing)
      "version": "1.7.2",             // probed via `--version` invocation (null if probe fails)
      "issues": []                    // free-text problems (e.g., "version too old")
    },
    {"name": "insanely-fast-whisper", "available": false, "path": null, "version": null,
     "issues": ["binary not found on PATH; override via FRANKEN_WHISPER_INSANELY_FAST_BIN"]},
    {"name": "whisper-diarization",   "available": true,  "path": "/usr/bin/python3",
     "version": "3.11.4", "issues": []}
  ],
  "ffmpeg": {                         // single dependency, same shape
    "name": "ffmpeg", "available": true,
    "path": "/usr/bin/ffmpeg", "version": "6.0", "issues": []
  },
  "database": {                       // SQLite store at --db
    "name": "database", "available": true,
    "path": ".franken_whisper/storage.sqlite3",
    "version": "schema_v4",
    "issues": []
    // The full StorageDiagnostics (page_count, page_size, journal_mode,
    // wal_checkpoint{busy, log_frames, checkpointed_frames}, freelist_count,
    // integrity_check) is available via the library's RunStore.diagnostics();
    // the robot event surfaces only the user-relevant subset.
  },
  "resources": {                      // host headroom
    "disk_free_bytes": 50000000000,
    "disk_total_bytes": 250000000000,
    "memory_available_bytes": 8000000000,
    "memory_total_bytes": 16000000000
  },
  "overall_status": "ok"              // "ok" / "degraded" / "error"
}
```

**`overall_status` derivation.**

- `ok`: at least one backend available, ffmpeg present (or not needed for current workload), database healthy.
- `degraded`: one or more backends missing but at least one usable; or ffmpeg missing but the built-in decoder covers the formats actually being used.
- `error`: no backends available, OR database integrity check failed, OR critical dependency missing.

**Field stability.** The schema is part of the `1.x` contract (currently `1.1.0`; the listen event family was an additive minor bump). New fields may be added but no existing fields will be renamed or removed within the 1.x line. Agents should ignore unknown fields rather than fail on them.

---

## Failure Modes Catalog

Each `FW-*` error has a characteristic in-the-wild signature. Knowing what to look for cuts triage time substantially.

| Error code | Typical signature in `run_error` payload | Most common cause | First triage step |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `FW-IO` | `"failed to open audio.mp3: No such file or directory"` | Path typo, deleted file, permission denied | `ls -la <path>` |
| `FW-JSON` | `"invalid JSON at line N column M"` | Backend produced malformed output (rare) or a corrupted JSONL snapshot during sync import | `cat <file> \| jq .` for the offending file |
| `FW-CMD-MISSING` | `"whisper-cli not found on PATH"` | Backend binary not installed or shadowed | `which whisper-cli`; set `FRANKEN_WHISPER_WHISPER_CPP_BIN` |
| `FW-CMD-FAILED` | `"command failed with exit status N: <stderr tail>"` | Backend crashed, bad model file, out-of-memory, hostile audio | Re-run the backend command directly with the rendered args |
| `FW-CMD-TIMEOUT` | `"command exceeded timeout of N ms"` | Audio too long for budget, slow hardware, network model download mid-run | Raise `--timeout` or `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_BACKEND_MS` |
| `FW-BACKEND-UNAVAILABLE` | `"no backend available for request (diarize=true, hf_token=missing)"` | No backend supports requested feature set | Install a diarization-capable backend or drop `--diarize` |
| `FW-INVALID-REQUEST` | `"--input, --stdin, --mic are mutually exclusive"` | Contradictory CLI flags, malformed JSON request via library | Drop one of the conflicting flags |
| `FW-STORAGE` | `"database is busy"` or `"PRAGMA integrity_check: out of order"` | Concurrent writer, corrupted DB, disk full | `franken_whisper robot health`; consider JSONL rebuild |
| `FW-UNSUPPORTED` | `"backend X does not support diarization"` | Requested capability the chosen backend lacks | Switch backends or remove the capability flag |
| `FW-MISSING-ARTIFACT` | `"backend completed but did not produce expected output file"` | Backend version skew, model didn't load | Inspect the work dir under `.franken_whisper/work/` |
| `FW-CANCELLED` | `"cancelled at stage backend"` | Ctrl+C or deadline hit | Re-run with longer timeout if intended |
| `FW-STAGE-TIMEOUT` | `"stage `normalize` exceeded budget of 180000 ms"` | Pathological input, contention | Raise the relevant `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_*_MS` |

In robot mode each of these arrives as a `run_error` event with `code` set to one of the six `FW-ROBOT-*` codes (see the error-code mapping table earlier). The internal `FW-*` variant is preserved in the `message` field for further triage.

---

## Performance Tuning Guide

The default budgets and tunables are calibrated for a typical local workload (a few minutes of audio, a single backend, no heavy contention). Three tuning vectors matter most:

### 1. Stage budgets

Watch the `orchestration.latency_profile` event. Stages tagged `decrease_budget_candidate` (≤ 30% utilization) are over-budgeted; stages tagged `increase_budget` (≥ 90% utilization) are at risk of `FW-STAGE-TIMEOUT`. Adjust via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_<NAME>_MS`. Common adjustments:

| Situation | Tuning |
|-----------|--------|
| Long audio on a slow CPU | raise `BACKEND_MS` to 1800000 (30 min) |
| Microphone capture of 10+ minutes | raise `INGEST_MS` to 60000 |
| Cold-start with large models | raise `BACKEND_MS` to absorb model load time |
| Diarization whose processing time may exceed 15 minutes | raise `DIARIZE_MS` to 1800000 (30 min) |
| Container with strict CPU limits | raise everything except `CLEANUP_MS` 2–3× |

### 2. Backend selection

Force-pick when you know better than the router:

```bash
# Always use whisper.cpp on Apple Silicon (Metal is fast, batching doesn't help)
franken_whisper transcribe --input a.mp3 --backend whisper-cpp --model large-v3

# Always use insanely-fast-whisper on a CUDA box doing batch jobs
franken_whisper transcribe --input a.mp3 --backend insanely-fast --batch-size 24 --flash-attention
```

If you want adaptive behavior but want to seed the posteriors, run a small calibration corpus through `--backend auto` once. The router will absorb the empirical success rates into its Beta distributions and route accordingly going forward.

### 3. Audio preprocessing

If you control the audio pipeline upstream, pre-normalize to 16 kHz mono WAV. The Normalize stage detects this and becomes a passthrough, saving ~260 ms per run (significant when transcribing thousands of files). `ffmpeg -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le` is the canonical incantation.

### Speculative streaming

`--speculative` is a latency tool, not an accuracy tool. Use it when you need partial transcripts for a live UI; don't use it for batch processing (the dual-model overhead reduces throughput vs. running the quality model alone). Tune `--speculative-window-ms` based on your UI's update tolerance: smaller windows = lower partial latency but more corrections; larger windows = higher latency but fewer retractions.

### When to disable persistence

`--no-persist` skips the Persist stage entirely (~10 ms saved per run). Use it when:

- The output stream is consumed downstream and the DB record would never be queried.
- You're benchmarking inference time.
- You're running on a filesystem where SQLite WAL files would land in an inconvenient place.

---

## Disk Usage Growth Model

The SQLite database grows roughly linearly with transcribed audio. Rough estimates (your mileage varies with how chatty the audio is and how many events your pipeline emits):

| Workload | DB growth rate |
|----------|----------------|
| Default pipeline, mostly-default flags, talky English audio | ~1–3 KB per transcript-minute |
| With diarization, multi-speaker | +20–40% (extra segments + speaker labels) |
| With `--word-threshold` and word-level timestamps | +50–100% (word-arrays in `result_json`) |
| With speculative streaming | +30–60% (extra `transcript.*` events) |

Per 1,000 hours of transcribed audio, expect the database to grow to roughly 100–250 MB in the default configuration, 200–500 MB with diarization and speculation. WAL files add transient overhead; run `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` periodically (or let SQLite checkpoint naturally between sessions) to keep them bounded.

JSONL snapshots are larger than the SQLite database (no compression by default, redundant text), roughly 2–3× the DB size. Pipe through `gzip` for ~5–10× compression ratio on JSONL (which is highly repetitive). The import path transparently handles `.gz` so gzipped snapshots are first-class.

---

## Extension Guide: Adding a New Backend

To add a new backend (say, a Vosk or wav2vec2 bridge):

1. **Add a `BackendKind` variant** in `src/model.rs` and update `BackendKind::as_str()` / `parse_backend()` / serde derives.
2. **Create `src/backend/<new>.rs`** implementing the `Engine` trait:
   ```rust
   pub trait Engine: Send + Sync {
       fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
       fn kind(&self) -> BackendKind;
       fn capabilities(&self) -> EngineCapabilities;
       fn is_available(&self) -> bool;
       fn run(
           &self,
           request: &TranscribeRequest,
           normalized_wav: &Path,
           work_dir: &Path,
           timeout: Duration,
       ) -> FwResult<TranscriptionResult>;
   }
   ```
3. **Wire into `BackendRouter`** in `src/backend/mod.rs`:
   - Add to the engine enumeration.
   - Add a prior `(α, β)` to `prior_for()`.
   - Add a `quality_proxy(kind, request)` entry for both diarize and non-diarize cases.
   - Add a `latency_proxy` base cost.
   - Extend the loss matrix dimensions if you're adding a fourth action; otherwise reuse an existing action slot.
4. **Add an availability probe**: set the appropriate `FRANKEN_WHISPER_*_BIN` env var convention and update `command_exists()` lookup.
5. **Add capabilities**: fill in `EngineCapabilities { supports_diarization, supports_translation, supports_word_timestamps, supports_gpu, supports_streaming }`.
6. **Update `robot health` and `robot backends`**: the `BackendsReport` builder enumerates known engines.
7. **Add an `EngineCapabilities` row to the documentation table** in this README.
8. **Write tests** in `tests/backend_mock_tests.rs` and add a golden fixture under `tests/fixtures/golden/<new>_native_output.json`.
9. **Add conformance fixtures** under `tests/fixtures/conformance/corpus/` for cross-engine comparison.
10. **Decide on rollout stage**: if you're shipping a native pilot, start at `Shadow`. The conformance harness will gate promotion through `Validated → Fallback → Primary → Sole`.

The Bayesian router will start with the prior you set, then learn empirical reliability across runs. You don't need to do anything special to teach it.

---

## Extension Guide: Adding a New Pipeline Stage

To add a new stage (say, post-transcription summarization):

1. **Add a `PipelineStage` variant** in `src/orchestrator.rs` and update `as_str()` / `Display`.
2. **Add a budget knob**: a field on `StageBudgetPolicy`, a `STAGE_BUDGET_*_ENV` constant, and a default value.
3. **Decide whether the stage is in `DEFAULT_STAGES`** or opt-in via `PipelineBuilder`.
4. **Implement the stage** as a function that takes `(&mut PipelineCx, &mut RunReport, &TranscribeRequest, &CancellationToken)` and returns `FwResult<()>`. Use the established pattern:
   ```rust
   fn execute_stage_<name>(...) -> FwResult<()> {
       emit_event(cx, "<stage>.start", message, payload);
       cx.token.checkpoint()?;
       // ... do the work ...
       cx.token.checkpoint()?;
       emit_event(cx, "<stage>.ok", message, payload);
       Ok(())
   }
   ```
5. **Add ordering constraints** to `PipelineConfig::validate()` if your stage has dependencies (e.g., must run after `Backend`).
6. **Add `*.skip` handling**: emit the skip event with a structured reason payload when the stage is configured but isn't needed for this run.
7. **Add `*.cancelled` and `*.error` paths**: both must emit before propagating the error so the NDJSON contract is preserved.
8. **Test**: unit-test the stage in isolation, then add an integration test exercising the full pipeline with the stage enabled.
9. **Update the documentation tables in this README**: Pipeline Stages diagram, Stage Budgets table, Stage Codes list, Dynamic Stage Composition table.

The orchestrator handles cancellation, finalizers, evidence accumulation, and latency profiling for you; your stage only needs to do its job and emit events.

---

## The Cancellation Token Contract

Every stage in the pipeline interacts with `CancellationToken`. Authors writing new stages or backends should follow these invariants:

1. **`token.checkpoint()` is cheap**: it's just two atomic reads (Ctrl+C flag, deadline check). Call it liberally between unit chunks of work.
2. **Subprocess invocations must use `run_command_cancellable()`**: the basic `run_command()` and `run_command_with_timeout()` don't honor the token. Long-running backends should use the cancellable variant.
3. **Database writes must checkpoint before `COMMIT`**: never write to SQLite without one final `token.checkpoint()?` immediately before the `RELEASE SAVEPOINT`. The savepoint mechanism guarantees rollback if the checkpoint fires.
4. **Finalizers must respect the cleanup budget**: register them via `cx.finalizers.push(...)` and they'll run in LIFO order under a 5-second total budget. Don't do unbounded work in a finalizer (e.g., don't recurse a huge directory tree).
5. **Drop checkpoint at stage boundaries**: clear the `stage_start` timer when transitioning so elapsed time from a cancelled stage doesn't leak into the next stage's latency profile.
6. **Emit `*.cancelled` before returning**: even on cancellation, the NDJSON contract requires a final event for the stage before pipeline termination.

Following these invariants gives cooperative cancellation a bounded cleanup
path: owned subprocesses are terminated, transactions roll back, finalizers run
within budget, and interruption maps to exit code 130. Cleanup failures remain
errors rather than being reported as successful cancellation.

## Debugging Recipes

| Scenario | Recipe |
|----------|--------|
| **"Why did the router pick that backend?"** | `franken_whisper robot routing-history --limit 1 --run-id <RUN_ID> \| jq` — inspect the posterior snapshot, calibration score, and Brier score at decision time |
| **"What did the backend actually output?"** | `RUST_LOG=franken_whisper::backend=trace franken_whisper transcribe ...` and inspect the rendered subprocess command (with secrets redacted) |
| **"Where did the time go?"** | Look at the `orchestration.latency_profile` event; `service_ms` per stage and per-stage tuning recommendation |
| **"Why is SQLite slow?"** | `franken_whisper robot health` → `database.wal_checkpoint.log_frames` and `database.freelist_count`; if either is climbing, run `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE); VACUUM;` |
| **"Why did the speculative model retract?"** | Look at the `transcript.retract` event's `reason` and the `transcript.correct` event's `drift` payload; tune `--correction-tolerance-wer` if false retractions are too aggressive |
| **"Why is TTY audio glitchy?"** | Run `tty-audio retransmit-plan` on the captured stream; inspect the `DecodeReport`'s `gaps`, `duplicates`, `integrity_failures` counts |
| **"Why isn't auto-provisioning working?"** | `RUST_LOG=franken_whisper::audio=debug` and watch for the `ffmpeg auto-provision` log lines; check `FRANKEN_WHISPER_AUTO_PROVISION_FFMPEG` is not `0`; verify network access to `johnvansickle.com` |
| **"Why does my native pilot disagree?"** | `franken_whisper robot routing-history` → check `native_rollout_stage` per decision; run the conformance harness directly against the disagreeing fixture to see the violation report |

The general pattern: every adaptive behavior in `franken_whisper` is queryable. There is no "secret state". Every routing decision, every speculation correction, every retransmit round, every stage budget decision is recorded in events or evidence ledgers you can inspect post-hoc.

---

## Multi-Run Routing Walk-through

Three sequential `--backend auto` runs against the same machine, showing how the Bayesian router learns:

**Run 1: cold start.** Empty calibration window, only priors:

```
posterior[whisper_cpp]:         Beta(7, 3) → mean 0.700
posterior[insanely_fast]:       Beta(6, 4) → mean 0.600
posterior[whisper_diarization]: Beta(5, 5) → mean 0.500
calibration: 0 observations → fall back to static priority
chosen: whisper_cpp (top of static priority for non-diarize)
outcome: success
```

**Run 8: 7 successes so far.** Calibration window fills slowly:

```
posterior[whisper_cpp]: Beta(7 + 0.86×7, 3 + 0.14×7) = Beta(13.0, 4.0) → mean 0.765
calibration: 7 observations → still using static priority (need ≥ 5, but also need calibration_score ≥ 0.3 and Brier ≤ 0.35)
chosen: whisper_cpp (still static)
outcome: success
```

**Run 23: enough data, adaptive routing engages.**

```
posterior[whisper_cpp]:         Beta(25.6, 4.4)  → mean 0.853
posterior[insanely_fast]:       Beta(15.72, 6.28) → mean 0.715 (12 obs)
posterior[whisper_diarization]: Beta(5, 5)        → mean 0.500 (still no data; was never picked)
calibration: 23 observations, Brier = 0.18, score = 0.82 → adaptive mode
loss matrix evaluation favors whisper_cpp by ~2 points
chosen: whisper_cpp (now via adaptive selection, not static fallback)
emit: routing_decision { calibration_score: 0.82, brier_score: 0.18, fallback_active: false }
outcome: success
```

**Run 48: a transient whisper_cpp failure shifts the posterior.**

```
posterior[whisper_cpp]: Beta(33.4, 11.6) → mean 0.742  (5 failures absorbed)
posterior[insanely_fast]: Beta(22.9, 9.1) → mean 0.716
calibration: 48 observations, Brier = 0.21, score = 0.79 → adaptive mode
loss matrix evaluation: whisper_cpp's failure cost now > insanely_fast's
chosen: insanely_fast (the router learned to shift)
outcome: success → posterior[insanely_fast] = Beta(23.7, 9.3) → mean 0.718
```

The router is doing nothing exotic: it blends priors with empirical data via Beta-conjugate updates, weights the result against the multi-factor loss matrix, and falls back when calibration degrades. The audit trail (`routing_decision` events plus the evidence ledger) makes every shift inspectable.

## Speaker Diarization Paths

| Aspect | Native Sortformer | Rust acoustic | Rust ECAPA-only | Rust ECAPA-fused | External | TinyDiarize |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Selection | `auto` default or `--diarization-engine sortformer` | `--diarization-engine acoustic` | `--diarization-engine ecapa` | `--diarization-engine ecapa-fused` (JSON: `ecapa_fused`) | `--diarization-engine external` | `--tiny-diarize` |
| Speaker identity evidence | Learned anonymous activity lanes; no biometric identity claim | Hand-authored waveform voice features | Pinned ECAPA embeddings; no acoustic channel evidence in pair scoring | Pinned ECAPA embeddings plus bounded acoustic channel evidence when a selected consensus merge joins a compatible usable pair; otherwise generic consensus provenance | Backend-defined, normalized only after provenance checks | Decoder turn tokens |
| Dependencies | Built-in Rust + installer-provisioned, SHA-256-pinned Sortformer package | Built-in Rust + normalized PCM | Built-in Rust + user-installed, hash-pinned ECAPA safetensors | Same pinned local ECAPA package | Typically Python, model files, and possibly an HF token | whisper-cli |
| Output | Independent overlapping turns plus conservative projection to ASR segments | Independent turns plus conservative projection to ASR segments | The common turn/report/projection contract | The common turn/report/projection contract | Timed backend labels normalized to the common report | Inline turn hints |
| Known intervals | Identity enrollment routes to the acoustic fallback | Hard must-link and soft enrollment | Hard must-link and soft enrollment | Hard must-link and soft enrollment | Backend-specific | No |
| Speaker count | Inferred active lanes without a required count; hard capacity of four | Infer by default; optional soft range/prior or exact search constraint | Same bounded inference and constraint contract | Same bounded inference and constraint contract | Backend-specific | No |
| Unknown/overlap | Explicit independent overlap; unmatched evidence remains unknown | Explicit unknown and overlap suspicion | Same common handling | Same common handling | Backend-specific | No calibrated assignment |
| Accuracy authority | `DevelopmentUncertified`; selected by `auto` as the product default | Public-development evidence exists; rollout remains uncertified | `DevelopmentUncertified`; outside `auto` | `DevelopmentUncertified`; outside `auto` | Depends on the installed backend and corpus | No project accuracy certification |

Native Sortformer is the default for anonymous calls with no more than four
active speakers. Use acoustic diarization for dependency-light waveform evidence,
recordings outside the four-lane capacity, and auditable known intervals. Use
explicit `ecapa` when the pinned model is installed and
speaker identity should come only from ECAPA; use `ecapa-fused` when bounded
channel evidence is also appropriate and may be available. The supported-profile
redecode experiment additionally requires complete neural tracklet coverage;
missing embeddings remain UNKNOWN except for immutable hard attribution. Both
are development-uncertified. Use an
external engine only when its model/deployment tradeoff is deliberate.
TinyDiarize is a turn hint, not a speaker-profile substitute.

## Source Separation Tradeoffs (`--no-stem`)

The external diarization backend may run Demucs vocal isolation before
clustering. The Rust acoustic engine does not invoke Demucs or Python.

**Keep stemming on (default) when:**

- Background music or significant ambient noise.
- Multiple overlapping speakers.
- Recordings with reverb / echo.

**Disable with `--no-stem` when:**

- Clean studio recordings (no benefit, just wasted compute).
- Real-time pipelines where the +5–15 s/min of Demucs latency is unacceptable.
- Memory-constrained environments (Demucs is the biggest single memory user in the pipeline).

The Source Separate stage has its own budget (`FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_SEPARATE_MS`, default 30 s); raise it for long audio or lower it to fail fast on resource-constrained hosts.

## Pre-Flight Production Checklist

Before deploying `franken_whisper` to a production workflow, walk through:

- [ ] **Native packages installed.** `fw doctor --json` returns `ready=true`, proving both compiled model trust roots pass.
- [ ] **HuggingFace token configured** (only if using the external pyannote diarization backend). Set via `FRANKEN_WHISPER_HF_TOKEN`. Verify redaction works by triggering an external diarization run with `RUST_LOG=debug` and confirming the token does not appear in logs.
- [ ] **Pinned ECAPA package installed** (only if using `ecapa` or `ecapa-fused`). Verify the filename, auxiliary-model directory, and SHA-256 from Prerequisites; no HF token is needed.
- [ ] **ffmpeg accessible** (if you'll transcribe video or use mic capture). Either system-installed, manually placed, or auto-provisioned. Verify with `franken_whisper robot health` → `ffmpeg.available=true`.
- [ ] **State directory writable.** `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STATE_DIR` (or default `.franken_whisper/`) is on a partition with enough free space for your expected DB growth.
- [ ] **Stage budgets sized.** The limits apply to processing wall time, not audio duration. Raise `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_BACKEND_MS` or `FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_DIARIZE_MS` only when the target host may need more than the configured stage budget.
- [ ] **Backup strategy.** Schedule periodic `sync export-jsonl` + off-host copy. Test the restore path at least once.
- [ ] **Concurrent agent expectations documented.** If multiple processes will write to the same DB, all must use `RunStore::begin_concurrent_session()` (or accept SQLITE_BUSY retries on conflict).
- [ ] **Native rollout stage chosen.** Default `sole` is the all-native product path. Set another stage only when you deliberately want bridge compatibility behavior.
- [ ] **Error handling integrated.** Your downstream consumer differentiates `run_complete` from `run_error` events in robot mode, and handles each `FW-ROBOT-*` code appropriately.
- [ ] **Disk monitoring in place.** Alert on `disk_free_bytes / disk_total_bytes < 0.10` and on `wal_checkpoint.log_frames` climbing across consecutive `robot health` probes.
- [ ] **Live sessions sized** (`fw robot listen`). The confirm lane keeps a second model in memory alongside the resident fast lane — plan RAM for both (tiny fast lane + large-v3-turbo quality lane), or set `--quality-model none` on memory-constrained hosts. Grant microphone access BEFORE headless/SSH deployment (macOS TCC prompts never render over SSH); `fw robot listen --list-devices` proves capture works. Decode throughput follows the global Rayon pool, which is built once at first use (`ensure_default_rayon_pool`, src/backend/mod.rs) — set `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` explicitly when sizing a dedicated live host for latency rather than throughput.

## Robot Schema Dump (`robot schema`)

`franken_whisper robot schema` emits a single JSON document describing every event type, every required field, every optional field, every payload sub-schema, and the canonical timestamp tolerance. Use it to drive client codegen, JSON-Schema validators, or auto-generated documentation:

```bash
franken_whisper robot schema | jq '.events | keys'
# [
#   "backends.discovery",
#   "health.report",
#   "listen.session_start",
#   "listen.session_stats",
#   "listen.warning",
#   "routing_decision",
#   "run_complete",
#   "run_error",
#   "run_start",
#   "speech_started",
#   "stage",
#   "transcript.confirm",
#   "transcript.correct",
#   "transcript.delta",
#   "transcript.partial",
#   "transcript.retract",
#   "transcript.speculation_stats",
#   "utterance_end"
# ]

franken_whisper robot schema | jq '.events["run_complete"].required'
# ["event", "schema_version", "run_id", "trace_id", "started_at",
#  "finished_at", "backend", "language", "transcript", "segments",
#  "acceleration", "diarization", "warnings", "evidence"]

franken_whisper robot schema | jq '.events["routing_decision"].payload'
# describes the loss_matrix, posterior snapshot, calibration metrics,
# fallback_active flag, evidence ledger entry, etc.
```

The schema document is part of the `1.x` contract (currently `1.1.0`): adding new event types requires a minor-version bump, and renaming or removing required fields requires a major-version bump. Schema version is reported on every event so agents can detect mismatch instantly.

## Recipe Cookbook

Idiomatic patterns for common one-off tasks.

### Generate SRT subtitles for a folder of videos

```bash
for f in videos/*.mp4; do
  franken_whisper transcribe --input "$f" --backend whisper-cpp --model large-v3 \
    --output-srt --json > /dev/null
done
# Each video gets a sibling .srt file alongside it.
```

### Build a searchable transcript archive

```bash
franken_whisper sync export-jsonl --output ./archive
jq -r '.run_id + "\t" + .transcript' ./archive/runs.jsonl > transcripts.tsv
# Now feed transcripts.tsv into any full-text index.
```

### Tail the live pipeline as a continuous status line

```bash
franken_whisper robot run --input meeting.mp3 --backend auto 2>/dev/null \
  | jq -r 'select(.event == "stage") | "[2K\r[\(.stage)] \(.code)"' \
  | tr -d '\n'
```

### Filter routing decisions where the router fell back to static

```bash
franken_whisper robot routing-history --limit 100 \
  | jq '.[] | select(.fallback_active == true) | {decision_id, observed_state, brier_score}'
```

### Validate all replay packs in a directory

```bash
for d in replay_packs/*/; do
  for f in env.json manifest.json repro.lock tolerance_manifest.json; do
    [ -f "$d/$f" ] || echo "MISSING: $d/$f"
  done
done
# Cross-check: re-running the same input should produce byte-identical packs
```

### Confirm a backend version drift

```bash
franken_whisper transcribe --input fixtures/canary.wav --backend whisper-cpp --json \
  | jq '.replay.backend_version'
# Compare against the version recorded in your last known-good replay envelope.
# Any difference is a backend upgrade; trigger conformance re-validation.
```

### Bulk-set stage budgets via env-file

```bash
cat > /etc/franken_whisper.env <<EOF
FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_BACKEND_MS=1800000
FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_DIARIZE_MS=1800000
FRANKEN_WHISPER_STAGE_BUDGET_NORMALIZE_MS=300000
EOF
env $(cat /etc/franken_whisper.env | xargs) franken_whisper transcribe --input long.mp3 --json
```

### Cap memory by routing diarization to a separate process

```bash
# Process A: do the transcription only
franken_whisper transcribe --input meeting.mp3 --backend whisper-cpp --no-stem \
  --db /tmp/runs.sqlite3 --json

# Process B: post-process for speakers in a memory-isolated context
# (run later, on different hardware, or in a smaller resource envelope)
```
