# Negative Evidence Ledger

This ledger records blocked, neutral, rejected, or non-comparable performance
evidence. It exists to prevent stale optimism from being reused as proof.

## 2026-06-24 - franken_whisper-cod-b kickoff

### Scope

- Goal: dominate the original OpenAI Whisper / `whisper.cpp` lineage on realistic
  workloads with measured head-to-head ratios.
- Required comparator: current `franken_whisper` native or pipeline path vs the
  original implementation on the same worker, same model, same audio, same
  correctness gate.
- Required build lane: crate-scoped `rch` benchmark with
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/franken_whisper-cod-b`.

### Fresh evidence collected

| Workload | Franken path | Original path | Ratio vs original | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Native engine criterion bench | `native_engine_bench` via `rch` | none | N/A | Completed native-only; useful routing, not head-to-head |
| Exact requested bench command | `cargo bench --release -p franken_whisper --bench native_engine_bench` | none | N/A | Blocked: Cargo rejects `--release` for `bench` |
| Head-to-head `whisper.cpp` run | none | `whisper-cli` | N/A | Blocked: `whisper-cli` not installed on this host |
| Model-gated native E2E | `tiny.en` / `large-v3-turbo` | `ggml-*.bin` | N/A | Blocked: no local ggml model files found in default search dirs |

### Historical evidence, not fresh proof

These artifacts are useful for routing but are not current head-to-head proof:

- `README.md` claims `tiny.en` 11 s clip: native CPU 475 ms vs `whisper.cpp`
  1,105 ms, or 2.33x faster; `large-v3-turbo` 9.73 s vs 9.59 s, parity.
- `tests/artifacts/perf/20260606T2341Z-scale-baseline/PASS4_RESULTS.md`
  records an internal native IF vs sequential tiny.en scale result:
  262.9 s vs pass-1 604 s on a 2 h call, or 2.30x faster. This is not an
  original-implementation comparison.
- The same PASS4 artifact rejects work stealing, lower worker thread minima,
  and model-size-aware worker policy as no-ship levers.

### Current blockers to real ratios

1. Install or point `FRANKEN_WHISPER_WHISPER_CPP_BIN` at a valid `whisper-cli`.
2. Provide the same ggml model files to both native and original paths, at
   minimum `ggml-tiny.en.bin` and `ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`.
3. Use Cargo's supported release-profile spelling for benches:
   `cargo bench --profile release ...` or document a wrapper that accepts
   `cargo bench --release`.
4. Run on one worker with interleaved A/B ordering and conformance gates:
   WER, segment timestamps, replay envelope, and exact model identity.

### First radical lever queue

These are candidates only. None may ship without a fresh profile, comparator,
green conformance, and a before/after ratio in this ledger.

| Rank | Lever | Graveyard / artifact mapping | Proof gate |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Native-vs-`whisper.cpp` head-to-head harness for 11 s, 10 min, 2 h, noisy, multilingual, and long-form YouTube audio | Evidence ledger + safe data-plane fallback; benchmark honesty gate | Same-worker ratio, WER 0.0000 or bounded drift, model identity hash |
| 2 | Decoder/logits f16-resident GEMV layout, SIMD/auto-vec, cache-sized bands, branchless hot loops | Vectorized execution, Swiss-table-style metadata thinking, cache-oblivious layout | `native_engine_bench` logits/decoder wins and E2E no regression |
| 3 | Built-in normalizer vs ffmpeg batch dominance: arena/buffer reuse, SIMD resample/mix, cache-friendly WAV writes | Cache-oblivious data movement, arena allocation, staged early exit | `normalize_bench` plus real MP3/FLAC/video A/B against ffmpeg |
| 4 | TTY audio throughput: reusable buffers, compression policy, FEC control frames, branchless decode checks | Adaptive controller with deterministic fallback, evidence ledger | `tty_bench`, decode SNR/integrity conformance, no protocol drift |
| 5 | Long-form pipeline scheduler: batch windows with bounded seams, no-regret/conformal guard for fallback | Learning-augmented policy with reject option and conservative fallback | Real 2 h audio, word-diff bound, p95 wall and RSS ratio |

### Filed perf-lever beads

- `bd-zk43`: P0 native vs `whisper.cpp` real-workload head-to-head harness,
  dependent on the broader ledger-harness bead `bd-0hnz`.
- `bd-n0m3`: P1 decoder/logits f16 GEMV layout and SIMD lever.
- `bd-3nw3`: P1 built-in audio normalization vs ffmpeg batch dominance.
- `bd-cy9u`: P1 streaming TTY transport throughput and control-frame FEC.
- `bd-3vhz`: P1 long-form scheduler and speculative window policy.

The P1 levers depend on `bd-zk43` so product-speed claims cannot bypass the
original-comparator evidence gate.

## 2026-06-24 - franken_whisper-cod-a kickoff

### Ratio convention

`speed_ratio = original_wall_time / franken_wall_time`.

- `> 1.0`: franken is faster.
- `= 1.0`: parity.
- `< 1.0`: franken is slower.

### Existing original-vs-franken ratios normalized

These rows were mined from the checked-in performance artifacts and README
claims. They are useful routing evidence, but must be refreshed before any new
dominance claim ships.

| Workload | Franken path | Original path | Ratio vs original | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 11 s JFK, `tiny.en`, CPU | native release-perf, 475 ms | `whisper.cpp` CPU, 1,105 ms | 2.33x | Historical win; refresh required |
| 11 s JFK, `large-v3-turbo`, CPU | native release-perf, 9.731 s | `whisper.cpp` CPU, 9.585 s | 0.985x | Historical wall-time loss/parity; native had lower user CPU |
| 11 s JFK, `large-v3-turbo`, CPU vs GPU control | native CPU, 9.731 s | `whisper.cpp` Metal, 2.169 s | 0.223x | Historical loss vs GPU control; not a CPU claim |
| 2 h tiny workload policy comparison | native IF default, 262.9 s | native sequential pass, 604 s | N/A | Internal franken comparison; not original-vs-franken |
| YouTube metadata optimization | reduced metadata probes | prior franken path | N/A | Internal I/O win; not original-vs-franken |

### Abandoned or scoped-out historical levers

| Lever | Observed result | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fused QKV projection | About 16% slower in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Per-head batched matmul | About 4% slower in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Residual-add fusion | Slower in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Encoder scratch/output reuse | Neutral in prior artifacts | Rejected as no-ship |
| Encoder f16 panels | Overhead/regression in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Cross-attention f16 K/V | Rejected in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Wider cross-attention head workers | Neutral in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Per-token linear widening | About 29% slower in prior artifacts | Rejected |
| Work stealing / model-size-aware worker policy | No reliable long-form win in prior artifacts | Rejected |

### Perf-lever beads filed by cod-a

- `bd-0hnz`: P0 original-vs-franken benchmark ledger harness.
- `bd-1bjy`: P0 shipped release-profile native speed gap.
- `bd-vsg6`: P1 native word timestamp DTW vs `whisper.cpp`.
- `bd-z4o7`: P1 real codec normalization vs ffmpeg plus `whisper.cpp`.
- `bd-9sc3`: P1 diarization and noisy multi-speaker workloads.
- `bd-kdg7`: P2 live/speculative streaming TTFT vs original streaming baselines.

`bd-0hnz` blocks the downstream cod-a perf levers so optimization work cannot
bypass the original-comparator evidence gate.

### Rule for future entries

Every future entry must include: command, worker/host, git SHA, model SHA or
path, workload, original time, franken time, ratio, conformance result, verdict,
and whether the code was kept, reverted, or only routed into a bead.
